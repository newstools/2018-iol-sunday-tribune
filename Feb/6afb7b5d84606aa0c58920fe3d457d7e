DURBAN - The body of a 49-year-old man was found washed ashore near the Casuarina beach in Seatides, north of Durban, on Wednesday morning. This came hours after news that the man's son had committed suicide in Johannesburg. The man, a former resident of Tongaat, lived in Gauteng and had been in Durban for a relative’s funeral, according to a source linked to the rescue party. “He received a call last night that his son, around 22-years-old, committed suicide. He disappeared afterwards,” the source said. A search party, including family members, found the man’s vehicle abandoned at Casuarina Beach in Seatides, north of Durban. “His body was found washed ashore this morning,” the source added. The Tongaat community policing forum chairperson, and head of the Crime Emergency Response Team (CERT), Nazir Sadack, confirmed the incident and said the family had been notified, after CERT members discovered the body. “We presume that after hearing his son had committed suicide, he decided to take his own life,” Sadack said. According to a statement from the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (SADAG) anticipating a person's suicide requires an awareness of what is going on in their life. “Pay attention to the friend whose circumstances may have driven them to the conclusion that the only way to regain control of their life would be to end it. They would show signs of helplessness, hopelessness and worthlessness. Do not ignore the situation. Let the person know you care and reassure them that there is treatment available and ways to work through their problems, no matter how hopeless everything may seem.” the statement read. The Sunday Tribune is awaiting official comment from the police. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
