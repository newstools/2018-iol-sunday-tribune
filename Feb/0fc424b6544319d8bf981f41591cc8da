He said this happened when he questioned the credentials of the nurse who administered his blood test. The man has laid assault charges against the officers. Bruce Walker, 55, said he was in Durban two weeks ago to attend a relative’s birthday party and was stopped at a roadblock on Edwin Swales Drive. He admits he had consumed alcohol. He said: “A breathalyser test was done and I was taken into a vehicle for my blood to be drawn. “After hearing about an official who was not registered but administered blood tests, I asked to see the credentials of the person running the test.” He said police said they would forcibly hold him down and draw blood from him if he did not co-operate. So he co-operated. “I also asked if I could use a toilet and they said I should go outside and pee behind a vehicle. I refused to do that because there were women outside and that’s a rude thing to do. “This is when they approached me, handcuffed me, put me on the floor and beat me up.” Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said a case of assault had been opened at Brighton Beach police station for investigation and no arrests had been made. Deputy head of metro police Steve Middleton said Walker had opened a criminal charge on his advice. “I also handed the matter to our internal affairs unit for investigation.”  nabeelah.shaikh@inl.co.za  SUNDAY TRIBUNE
