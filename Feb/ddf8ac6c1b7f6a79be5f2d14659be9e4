On Monday, the Tropika Island of Treasure will air at 7.30pm and Lazarus, along with Lihle Ngubo,  20, of Pietermaritzburg, will be representing KwaZulu-Natal. For the 21-year-old Lazarus this will be her first foray into reality TV and she hopes the experience will open doors for her. Lazarus, who studied journalism at Durban University of Technology, works as a digital producer for East Coast Radio’s Breakfast Show host Darren Maule. “I studied broadcasting and I will be graduating in April, I would love to do a TV show in the future and I think I am on a right career path right now, “ said Lazarus. The reality show was shot last year on an island in the Maldives. It features South African celebrities who are paired with seven consumers who were chosen during nationwide auditions. Lazarus said she was in the right place at the right time. “I did not plan on entering. I used to work for Gateway’s marketing team so when Tropika Island of Treasure came for auditions at the mall, my manager pushed me to enter, I wasn’t really prepared but I did it for fun and I got in,” she said. She had a great time on the island and made friends. “I had a great time and I enjoyed all the challenges and activities we did on the island, we played, laughed and made friends, it was the best experience,” said Lazarus. She said If she wins the competition, she will invest in an apartment and use part of the prize money to travel.
