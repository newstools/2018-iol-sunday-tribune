The announcement was made following a successful protocol meeting between the SA Hajj and Umrah Council (Sahuc) and Saudi Arabian Hajj ministry officials. The quota was increased by 1000 people. South Africa’s original quota was 2500 and the additional quota numbers will bump it to 3500. The annual pilgrimage sees thousands of Muslims apply for accreditation each year and they are placed on a lengthy waiting list. Muslims are expected to complete Hajj at least once in their lifetime. Newlands, Durban residents Saleem, 60, and Hawa Moosa, 70, were among the lucky applicants to receive accreditation after the additional quota was introduced. They have been on the waiting list for five years. “It was a dream come true for us. My daughter, Shabnum, received an SMS to say we had been accepted. She woke us up at 3am with the good news and we were so emotional that we started to cry. “It’s something we’ve been saving for for a long time and, by the will of God, our time has finally arrived,” said Saleem Moosa. This year’s Hajj period begins in August.  nabeelah.shaikh@inl.co.za  SUNDAY TRIBUNE
