The Multinational Lung Cancer Control Programme (MLCCP) launched this week by the University of KwaZulu-Natal aims to bring lung cancer awareness to small communities. It will include tools for cancer screening that may lead to early detection. The launch by UKZN’s College of Health Sciences was attended by several medical experts, including nursing lecturer Hafsa Amod, who pledged her support to the programme. Amod, 42, of Chatsworth lost her father to lung cancer in 1984, when he was 63, and also her sister, who died two years ago at 50. “My father used to smoke cigarettes, while we believe my sister, who was a dressmaker, developed lung cancer due to fluff constantly around her,” she said. A team of young academics will be heading the programme in Chatsworth, the South Durban Basin and other areas. SUNDAY TRIBUNE Follow Us On Twitter Follow Us On Facebook
