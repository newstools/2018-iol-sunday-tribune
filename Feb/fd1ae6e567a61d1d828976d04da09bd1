DURBAN - THE appointment of Police Minister Bheki Cele during Monday's late night cabinet reshuffle has brought new hope to the family of slain footballer Senzo Meyiwa. Meyiwa's father, Sam Meyiwa, told the Sunday Tribune that they were hopeful that his sons killer would be found. Meyiwa Sr. also said he had mixed feelings about the news because fired police minister Fikile Mbalula had been trustworthy. “I was a bit shocked at his sudden removal but at the same time, I feel like my prayers have been answered. I have no doubt Cele will do a good job in getting the murderers behind bars. It was evident during his stint as a national commissioner that he was dedicated to fighting crime,” Meyiwa said. Meyiwa met Cele during a funeral two years ago. He said after exchanging pleasantries, Cele encouraged him never to let go of the case but to continue to seek feedback from police.
