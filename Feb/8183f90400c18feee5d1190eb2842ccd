DURBAN - THE family of a KZN gospel musician who fell to his death from the second floor of a shopping mall in the Czech Republic has appealed for help from the public to repatriate his body. Mandla Jiyane, 25, is reported to have fallen last weekend from the Flora shopping mall in Prague. The Zululand Gospel choir member went to the country with the group two years ago and had returned to pursue a music career. His family in Nseleni, near Richards Bay, were told of the death by his Czech partner, Lucie Kostelecka, who is also a musician. His family is battling to come to terms with his sudden death.

We were devastated to hear he had died,” he said. We have to repatriate his body to be buried at home but the costs are beyond our means. The father said the South African Embassy had given the family three options, which included Jiyane being buried in the Czech Republic, cremation or to repatriate.

We appeal to anyone who can assist us because we do not have money and we would like to bury my child at home,” he said. The father also suspects foul play over the death of his son. He said he was certain his son did not commit suicide and denied he used drugs. “One thing I know, my son wouldn’t have committed suicide. He was a happy soul. We communicated with him often and he looked forward to come back home. He never smoked and drank alcohol, he just loved music,” said Jiyane.  siphelele.buthelezi@inl.co.za  SUNDAY TRIBUNE Follow Us On Twitter Follow Us On Facebook
