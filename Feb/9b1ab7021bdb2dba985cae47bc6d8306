Last week the Sunday Tribune reported that a suspect had been arrested after two cars were struck by rocks on the N3 under Durban’s Tollgate bridge. Subsequent interviews with a complainant, Laphale 
Raphael Mbusu, reveal that the first incident happened on the Brickhill on-ramp to the N3, not far from Tollgate bridge. Mbusu said a man had stepped off the side of the road and smashed a large rock through the left side of his windscreen. Mbusu went to the Mayville police station to report the case.  Later in the day, Mbusu was called by police who told him a man had been apprehended by passersby who had seen him throw a rock from the bridge. Mbusu said he returned to the police station and identified the suspect as the man who had damaged his car. Following Mthalane’s arrest, metro police spokesperson Parbo Sewpersad said investigating officers believed the suspect was responsible for a number of rock-throwing incidents. Mthalane allegedly told an investigating officer that he was unemployed and enjoyed damaging cars.

When he appeared in court on Monday, he had bruises on his face and an open wound on his head. The court was told that he lived in an informal settlement in Cato Ridge. He was advised to apply for legal aid and held in custody. He faces charges of malicious damage to property. Yesterday, eThekwini deputy mayor Fawzia Peer, who has been implementing stronger security measures to combat rock-throwing, viewed the city’s hotspots from a helicopter flight. “Police along with private security officials will continue to clamp down on these atrocious acts,” she said.
