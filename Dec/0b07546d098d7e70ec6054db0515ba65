Speaking to the Sunday Tribune, Mpisane was upbeat and relieved that Sbahle was going home, having spent almost three months in hospital “Yes, we fetched our daughter from hospital and she is even walking on her own, and seeing her recovery has been nothing short of the miracle.” Mpisane added that even though the family were wealthy, it was only divine intervention that had helped her recover. “We put all our faith in God and nothing else.” Mpisane said there would be no celebration or party for Sbahle’s homecoming, but there would be prayers at home to thank God for seeing Sbahle through this difficult time. Sbahle, known as the “Fitness Bunnie”, was discharged from hospital on Friday. She was involved in a near-fatal accident on August 9. A Durban fire rescue crew had to use the jaws of life to free her from her severely damaged BMW 4 series car. Her father said previously that she had suffered multiple fractures. At the time, police said they would be investigating a case of reckless and negligent driving. Sbahle’s close friends posted pictures of a vibrant and radiant-looking Sbahle leaving the hospital in a wheelchair, followed by a picture of her standing next to her wheelchair. Sunday Tribune
