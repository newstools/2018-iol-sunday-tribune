Durban - As the case against a pastor continues in a Durban court, it has emerged that two of his church’s leaders had compiled a list of people who the pastor had had sexual relations with. The pastor, who cannot be named as he had not pleaded as yet, made his official bail application in the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court yesterday. During cross examination by state prosecutor, Sibongile Ngcobo, the pastor said he had helped a lot of families that had helped him when he was a child. He also said he has a Mercedes-Benz car that he paid R18 500 every month for in car instalments. When Ngcobo asked how much he was paid every month, the pastor was non-committal and this led to the prosecutor arguing that he was evasive about his income. The pastor, who works as a DJ for a local radio station added that he did not receive a salary for hosting his show despite being employed as a permanent staff member. The accused said his other source of income came from his MCing duties at events which he was invited to. This, he said, dictated his salary. The pastor's court appearances have been characterised by protests outside the courtroom with people from the Inkatha Freedom Party, Democratic Alliance and African National Congress all singing and dancing outside their courtroom. Unlike last month, today's protests did not have members of his congregation - which is said to have more than 2000 members and has six branches in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. Last month, the pastor's marquee church was torn down by community members from Richmond farm after allegations of rape surfaced against him. The man faces charges of rape, sexual assault, and kidnapping. The bail application continues. Daily News
