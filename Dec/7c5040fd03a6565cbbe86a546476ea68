A high-ranking Al Ansaar Foundation official has alleged that “endemic corruption, mismanagement, and maladministration” occurred within the non-profit organisation, in an open letter circulated on social media this week. Zaid Omarjee, Al Ansaar’s chief operations officer, said the foundation relied heavily on donors “to serve the community”, but officials within the organisation were working for “self-gain”. Omarjee took aim at the foundation’s board, in particular, Mahomed Abdool Gaffar (Mag) Joosab, the chairperson. “Joosab is the sole authority and all decisions are made by him, there have been no AGMs held annually and financial reports are not made available,” Omarjee claimed. He also noted two uncompleted levels of the building donated to the organisation 20 years ago. Omarjee believed wasteful expenditure hampered construction work. Omarjee further cited various alleged irregularities in how the foundation handled funds, staff appointments and the awarding of service contracts. However, a well placed source who asked not be named said Omarjee was bitter over being subpoenaed to appear before the foundation’s disciplinary committee (DC) in September. The notice to appear before the DC listed three charges which related to Omarjee being in breach of contract. Omarjee allegedly joined other individuals who registered companies in direct opposition to the aims of the foundation. When approached for comment Joosab referred this newspaper to Irfaan Bux, a fellow board member. Bux said his organisation would only comment once their board had met their legal team. The Jamiatul Ulama had not responded by publication. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
