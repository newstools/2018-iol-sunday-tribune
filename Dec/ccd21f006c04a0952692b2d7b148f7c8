The delay has caused a headache for ward councillors who said senior citizens were bombarding them with enquiries about their party, but they, too, were in the dark. The parties usually take place between November and December in the different wards. The mayor’s parlour, ward councillors, ward committee members and volunteers bring joy to about 60000 pensioners across 110 wards. Pensioners are treated to a lunch and receive food parcels. City council spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said this year’s programme, which had a budget of R15million, was delayed by tender processes. Last year the municipality was interdicted by an unsuccessful bidder citing allegations of unfair tender processes. The party went ahead despite the interdict. That matter is expected to go to trial in the new year. “It is an absolute disaster again. “It shows bad management and planning. They had the whole year to plan the event and they seem to always leave planning to the last minute. Nothing is official but I heard it is after Christmas (Day) and usually people and councillors are not around then,” DA councillor, Heinz de Boer said. IFP caucus leader Mdu Nkosi accused city council officials and political leaders of lacking professional ethics. “They have become part of procurement services which hampers the delivery of Christmas parties. “City officials also have conflicting interests in doing business with the city which is a major cause of the delays. It is the first time we will have such an important programme after Christmas. It is unfortunate that vulnerable people won’t have Christmas because of selfish officials,” he said. EFF Chief Whip, Siphiwe Ngiba said hosting the events after Christmas Day defeated its purpose. “The delay is evidence of poor management,” said Ngiba. Several ANC ward councillors, who did not want to be named, said they were embarrassed by the delay. They said the parties were likely to take place on December 29. Sunday Tribune
