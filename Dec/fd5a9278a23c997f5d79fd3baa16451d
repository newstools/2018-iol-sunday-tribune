IN twelve hours KwaZulu-Natal raised over a R1.2 million to help the underprivileged in the province. The East Coast Radio Toy Story Corporate Challenge Day on Friday at Gateway mall saw celebrities and radio personalities man the phone lines as pledges flowed through. The event was held in partnership with Toys R Us & Babies R Us. Now four schools, identified by the Department of Education, including Jabulani Primary, Maria Memorial, primary, Mqhati primary, and Nqongqotho primary schools, will benefit from the R1 253 297 raised. It's going to empower pupils to reach for greatness. That's according to East Coast Radio’s General Manager, Boni Mchunu, who thanked KZN for their pledges. “It’s incredible to see how our communities have come together to offer the spirit of Ubuntu to such a life changing initiative. KZN has done us very proud. All the money collected will be directed to the needs of the four schools that were identified by the Department of Education. The funds will go a long way towards better equipping these schools and our hope is to inspire and empower our learners to reach for greatness.” Musician, Mariechan Luiters, who was among celebs who lent their voices to the cause, said: “Thank you, East Coast Radio, for involving me. This was such a heartwarming experience because I, myself know what it’s like to grow up without toys so I know what this will mean to the kids." SUNDAY TRIBUNE
