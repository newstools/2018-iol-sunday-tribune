DURBAN - Gqom queen Babes Wodumo is in the middle of yet another controversy after she filmed herself chasing after a woman at the OR Tambo International Airport and swearing at her. It appeared the woman had ‘hushed’ at Babes Wodumo and her clique, although it was unclear who and how many people the hitmaker was accompanied by. The Wololo hitmaker did not take kindly at being ‘hushed’ at and told the woman she was not a chicken. Babes then followed the woman, confronted and cornered her. It appeared airport personnel intervened in the verbal altercation and the woman left, but Babes continued to swear at her in isiZulu. The incident was recorded live on Babes Wodumo’s Instagram.
