Durban - Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding an attack on a paramedic who was stabbed while entering the Emergency Medical Services base in Illovo on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast. Philani Nzuza was stabbed multiple times on his head and chest at the weekend. Nzuza was rushed to a Durban hospital where he is recovering. The attack has been condemned by KZN Health MEC, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo. "It is worrying that a health worker in full uniform going on duty can be attacked by thugs in this manner. We are glad he survived. The people who attacked him must have been under the influence of something that made them not to be in touch with reality," he said. During the visit, Nzuza recounted his ordeal to the MEC and described how his colleagues came to assist him. Dhlomo noted that a health worker operating ambulances is a critical staff member. "Even during the period of our massive protests against apartheid rule, health professionals were allowed to go through to hospitals and clinics because they could be going to save the lives of our people injured by the apartheid police. The behaviour of these thugs is seen as a practice that hinders our professionals from performing their national duty. We hope that the SAPS can do whatever it takes to apprehend these perpetrators of social ills," he said. Sunday Tribune
