DURBAN - Over a month after the “brutal” murder at a Tongaat farmhouse, the three accused are set to finally appear before the Durban Regional Court on Wednesday after postponements in their previous appearances. Smangaliso Michael Mayela, 21, Nkosinathi Ngcobo, 20, and Odwa Zide, 21, stand accused of murder and robbery with aggravated circumstances. The attack on the farmhouse in Esnembe near OThongathi was described as “brutal and well-orchestrated” by neighbours who gathered at the scene in the aftermath of the bloody incident.
