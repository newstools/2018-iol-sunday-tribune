Durban - Two people have died as a fire destroyed a house in Zamani ship near Darnall on the Kwa-Zulu Natal North Coast on Thursday. Dylan Meyrick for IPSS Rescue said that neighbours had reported hearing an explosion which was believed to be a gas bottle. "They raced to the scene to assist, but when they got to the house it was already well alight and there was nothing they could do," he said. IPSS Rescue personnel and the KwaDukuza Fire Department were at the scene. Firefighters extinguished the fire and then made the grim discovery of two very badly burnt bodies inside the house. The bodies are believed to be those of a man in his early forties and a woman in her mid twenties. The identities of the victims is still to be established and the next of kin have to be informed. Investigations are continuing. The Independent on Saturday
