Recently, Charles connected in a meaningful way with other bikers who share a passion for riding when he joined the East Coast Motor Cycle Club (ECMCC), which was launched this month. Charles, a former water treatment specialist with the CSIR who has now retired, said joining the ECMCC “family” had given his riding new purpose. He said some of the goals of the club were to reach out to less fortunate people and the aged with their charitable initiatives and to provide mentorship to youngsters. “Our mission as a club is to improve the lives of others in whatever way we can help,” said Charles, who is the club’s oldest member and honorary president. First love Charles’s love affair with bikes started in the 1960s. His first bike was a Triumph Bonneville, which he bought for R60. He continued to ride bikes when he got married and it was the mode of transport he and his wife Savy used to go to work. As his family got larger, Charles switched to driving cars. But on his 60th birthday, after a 25-year hiatus, Charles started riding again. He has since been on many road trips. His most memorable trip was in 2015 when he cruised around the country on his Harley with some friends. “That was my best road trip ever. I also celebrated my 60th birthday on that trip, which lasted 11 days and  covered 5888km. “I never got tired. It was a pleasure riding my Harley, which is built for comfort,” he said. Charles said he would continue riding a motorcycle until he could no longer do
