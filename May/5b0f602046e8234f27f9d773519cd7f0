To reiterate my message in my address to staff and students yesterday; we as EMC understand the need for the student leadership and body to show solidarity in memory of their late fellow student as well as demonstrate support for the national movement of violence against women". Malaza said the university sympathised with the Khumalo family and students. "We sympathise with the family who for the second time since the 2nd of May, will come face to face with the accused in court tomorrow. To this end, we believe that it is only fair to give our students some part of closure as they express their emotions in court just two days before the burial.” ALSO READ: Students flee after Zolile Khumalo murder
