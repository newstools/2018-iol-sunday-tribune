“Even though Siam’s gone, I still feel like she’s with me. When you love someone, they never really leave you,” said Carmen Nan Lee outside the court on Friday. She said Mother’s Day wouldn’t matter to her any more. “I often don’t even know what day of the week it is any more,” said Lee, who is planning to attend a rehabilitation facility in the Eastern Cape. This is after Lee spent last weekend behind bars after being arrested for malicious damage to property over a rental dispute with her landlord. She was released on a warning and will have to reappear in the Durban Magistrate’s Court soon. Lee claimed the arrest was unlawful and said her landlord should drop the charges against her. “I was intentionally locked out the property even though my stuff was still inside. “This to me was not lawful.” SUNDAY TRIBUNE
