Durban - Police are still on the hunt for a group of suspects who robbed a cash in transit guard of a money box in Umzinto on Thursday. National police spokesperson Brigadier Vish Naidoo said police were investigating a case of armed robbery after one armed suspect accosted a security official and fled with a money box from a cash-in-transit security guard. No shots were fired. He said it was unknown how many other suspects were involved. He said the unknown number of suspects fled with the money after drawing a firearm at a security guard. Naidoo said the money boxes defence mechanism was activated once the suspects fled in a red Toyota Etios car, which caused the unknown number of suspects to throw it out the window. They crashed not far from the robbery scene. Naidoo would not be drawn to disclosing what the money boxes ‘defensive mechanism’ did to potentially harm the suspects. He said police recovered a handgun at the crash scene and said police were still investigating if the car used in the robbery was stolen. He said a police chopper was activated but the suspects were still on the run. He said descriptions had been circulated to police units around the province.
