Durban - President Cyril Ramaphosa announced changes to Cabinet on Thursday, including the promotion of former youth league leader Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, who was appointed as Minister of Communications, Telecommunications and Postal Services. Ndabeni-Abrahams was promoted from her previous role as the deputy minister of communications. Ramaphosa announced Ndabeni-Abrahams, who will be seen as an appointed representative of the ANC Youth League and as part of the “generational mix” would lead two ministries. However, the two departments would remain separate until after the elections next year and would undergo a process of re-aligning. Taking to Twitter on Thursday afternoon, just after 1pm, Julius Malema crypitcally tweeted ‘Is Stella Tembisa Ndabeni-Abrahams here on Twitter guys? Looking for her, please help.’. The tweet was three hours before Ramaphosa made his announcement just after 4pm on Thursday.     Ndabeni-Abrahams tweeted Malema warmly and said “Yes, President am here”.   Malema later congratulated her on her new appointment.     Ndabeni-Abrahams biography on the Department of Communications, which was quick to update the website, showed that the 38-year-old is enrolled for a Masters in Telecommunications, Policy and Regulation Management at Wits University. The department said she also held a Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation Diploma in Telecommunications and Management's Systems, a Certificate in Telecommunications, Policy and Regulation Management from Wits University, an Advanced Certificate in Project Management from Rhodes University and a Project Management Diploma from Cranefields College. Meanwhile, some on Twitter responded with glee at Malema's cyptic tweet after Ramaphosa's announcement.                      Sunday Tribune
