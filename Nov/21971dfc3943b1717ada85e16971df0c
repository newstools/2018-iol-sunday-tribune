Durban - The family of murdered Paulpietersburg farmer Frieder Johannes Filter was relieved after two brothers charged for his murder in 2016 were sentenced to life imprisonment. A family spokesperson said they were relieved by the sentence on Wednesday. The 77-year-old pensioner was with his family on his Brainsweight Farm when they were approached by the armed murderers, brothers Sthembiso Shoba, 30, and Sabelo Abel Shoba , 29.  A third suspect was allegedly part of the robbers, but he remains at large. The Shoba brothers were sentenced to life in prison for the murder at the Madadeni High Court on Tuesday. Nothing was taken from the house and the brothers were arrested six days after the attack. Claus Lugte, a spokesperson for the Filter family, said the sentencing had brought relief to the family after two years of seeking closure. He appealed to the police to trace the third suspect who is still at large. “I hope they catch the remaining suspect soon, he needs to join his accomplices to get the punishment they deserve for the pain they have caused to the family,” he said. Lugte said it was not easy for the family to move on, but they were satisfied with the sentence. “We are satisfied with the sentencing, we hope to bury this behind us,” he said. Kwanalu spokesperson Sandy La Marque said the farmers organisation welcomed the sentence. The sentence sent a strong message against farm attacks, she said. KZN police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed a third suspect is still at large and said police were confident that he will still be arrested.
