DURBAN - Nine suspects, charged with public violence following a soccer knock-out match at Moses Mabhida Stadium on April 21, were convicted in the Durban Regional Court on Wednesday. Fans had stormed onto the pitch, destroying infrastructure and assaulting security guards after Kaizer Chiefs lost to Free State Stars in a semi-final cup match. Eleven suspects were eventually charged, with cases against two accused being provisionally withdrawn. Siphosenkosi Knowledge Memela, John Sibongiseni Khumalo, Kwezilomo Madiba, Cebolendoda Hadebe, Douglas Mhlaliseni Mkhize, Nolwethu Cokotha, Zibongile Njova, Sihle Duncan Zungu and Dennis Thusi were convicted for public violence on Wednesday. They will be sentenced on December 12 after the probation officers report is presented to court. And with the first semi-final of the Telkom Knockout between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates scheduled at the stadium on November 24, the conviction sends out a strong message against soccer hooliganism. Police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said the violence erupted after the match in April. He said police officers attached to the SAPS KZN Provincial Task team arrested three suspects. They then rounded up the remaining suspects. Naicker said the acting provincial commissioner at the time commended the task team officers for their work on the case saying, “We will not tolerate such hooliganism in this province.”
