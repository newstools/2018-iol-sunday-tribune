Durban - Police have identified the elderly man found murdered in his home in Pietermaritzburg this week as James William Satter McGlinchey. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the man's VW Polo car that was missing from his property has been recovered. It was recovered at Mount Ayliff in the Eastern Cape where it had been abandoned. Zwane said there no arrests made. “Investigations are continuing,” he said. Zwane said 94-year-old McGlinchey, who appeared to have been strangled, had been identified by members of his family. “A case of house robbery and murder was opened at the Alexandra Road police station,” he said. The murder happened three months after three elderly people were murdered at two neighbouring old age homes -- the Kenwyn Retirement Home and the Jacaranda Lodge -- in the provincial capital. In August, the Pietermaritzburg Regional Court sentenced 22-year-old Kershwin Goldstone to three terms of life imprisonment. His victims were Patricia Tugwell and Roland Heathcote, both 89, and 92-year-old Patricia O’Connor. Independent on Saturday
