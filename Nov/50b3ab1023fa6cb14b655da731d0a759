Durban - Seven people were nabbed by police in Umlazi for various crimes in the early hours of Saturday morning. Police said the Umlazi Trio Task Team were conducting an operation at their policing precincts aimed at rooting out any crime when they nabbed the seven suspects aged between 19 and 49. “A 36-year-old suspect was arrested in U section while he was heavily drunk and in possession of an unlicensed firearm with seven rounds of ammunition. The firearm was seized and he resisted arrest whilst insulting police officers,” said police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele. She said the suspect was charged for being in possession of an unlicensed firearm, handling a firearm whilst under the influence of intoxicating substance and resisting arrest. Mbele said the task team also arrested two suspects aged between 19 and 22 at Umlazi’s P section. “Two tuckshops were allegedly robbed by a group of suspects and an employee was shot and injured. Cash and property were stolen at gunpoint. Suspects will be charged for robbery and an attempted murder,” she said. Mbele said another four suspects aged between 22 and 49 were arrested for possession of drugs after they were found in possession of heroin capsules and mandrax tablets, also in Umlazi. She said the suspects would appear at the Umlazi Magistrates Court on Monday. Meanwhile, Mbhele said the Provincial Trio Task Team arrested a 27-year-old suspect on Thursday at Umlazi’s R section and charged him with possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. “He was found in possession of three unlicensed pistols with their serial numbers filed off and 112 rounds of ammunition. “He appeared in the Umlazi Magistrates Court where he was kept in custody pending an on-going police investigation to ascertain if he can be linked to robbery cases in Umlazi”, said Mbele.
