Trellidor South Africa has earned a certification by the Loss Prevention Certification Board for its design of the Trojan 3 EMESC T3000 security gate. It cost almost R3million to make in 18 months and was flown to the UK to be tried and tested in the harshest conditions. “It surpassed the testing requirements, which was a great reward for thousands of hours of hard work by our team in the development and design phase,” said Peter Rawson, Trellidor marketing and sales director. So valued are these types of certified gates that the intricacies of the design cannot be mentioned. Said Rawson: “Since receiving the requisite certification, we have shipped 12 of these world-class gates overseas to destinations that we cannot disclose due to their sensitive nature. “Our production plant is working its way through the order book for additional units and we are exploring new markets in Europe, Africa, the East and South America. “Demand in the international market was the primary motivation for the introduction of the Trellidor Trojan 3 EMESC T3000 to our Trellidor Retractable Security range. “But we are seeing increasing interest locally due to the high rate of violent robbery in the commercial arena and public spaces in South Africa.” Sunday Tribune
