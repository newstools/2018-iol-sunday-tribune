Durban - A DURBAN student is now the ambassador of an international organisation that brings together and empowers global leaders. Kwazini Zulu is a student in the College of Law and Management Studies at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. The student can now add another title to his name: One Young World ambassador. One Young World (OYW) is a UK-based charity that gathers together some of the brightest and most highly sought-after young leaders from around the world, empowering them to make lasting connections to create positive change. Zulu, who is also a freelance leadership and business consultant for small businesses was recently invited to the One Young World Summit at The Hague in The Netherlands. Here, he was among at least 1 800 delegates who were selected across 196 countries to attend the Summit and join the global network. Said Zulu: "Being selected to represent my country, city and university on such a global platform from thousands of equally capable if not more capable young leaders is truly a great honour for me." Among former delegates are Sir Richard Branson, Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu, former UN Secretary, General Kofi Annan, Unilever CEO, former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela, and actress, Emma Watson. Zulu added: "I had always believed that I had a calling to impact on people's lives through business leadership. I am honoured to be selected to participate in this prestigious gathering which ordinarily only world leaders and business executives would have access to. This means that I am a custodian of leadership and societal impact representing young leaders all around the world in my community, university, city and country."' SUNDAY TRIBUNE
