Durban - A 35-year-old Ntuzuma pastor was arrested on four counts of rape. The pastor, who has a church at Richmond Farm, was arrested this week and will appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court on Monday. “It is alleged that since 2015, the pastor has been preying on young girls raised by single parents, appearing to play a fatherly role to them. One victim reported that she approached the suspect and asked him to pray for her after she has not been feeling well. The pastor prayed for her and then requested her to get into his vehicle and took her to his residence at Avoca where he raped her,” said provincial police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele. The victim had been silent for three years, and only reported the matter to police this month. “On hearing that the suspect was allegedly raping young girls, angry members of the community damaged the church tent where he ministered and demanded that he not return to the area,” said Mbele.
