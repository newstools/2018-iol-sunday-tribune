A Durban brigadier is in line for a top position with Interpol. Brigadier Anbuen Scott Naidoo was nominated as the South African candidate for Interpol’s presidency. “Interpol’s strength is its diversity. It is over 100 years old and has a membership of 192 countries. “I am truly humbled to be nominated for this prestigious position,” said Naidoo. Naidoo is in Dubai for the 87th general assembly of Interpol and the elections are expected to happen from November 18 to 21. Naidoo was nominated among candidates from Russia and South Korea. He already has international policing experience, having been appointed to an Interpol executive committee in 2016. Prior to that he was the head of Interpol in South Africa. Naidoo said he was passionate about enhancing international police co-operation and utilising reputable platforms to encourage the sharing of crime information in order to address transnational criminal threats. The position of president became vacant after the resignation of China’s Meng Hongwei last month. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
