Durban - It seems that KFC has either changed their advertising agency or they have finally realised that contemporary humour is the way to go. For the longest time Nandos ruled the roost when it came to advertisements, but this time around KFC sucked the bone dry of its marrow. KFC dropped the advert on their YouTube page two weeks ago and it is nearing 500 000 views. It also has 385 likes, 21 dislikes,  and 83 comments.   More than anything, the advert depicts what many South Africans think when they are either at Home Affairs or the licensing department, especially when the workers say the system is offline. This is what YouTube viewers said about the ad: Lloyd Berry: When KFC has one over Nando's... Brilliant advert! Londani Tambani: Lmao we can tell KFC have changed the agency now QEA ROS: It's just that this is literally what it feels like is happening sometimes... in home affairs and the traffic department Gadget :p: Exactly what we've always thought they were saying but never had the opportunity to hear what they were thinking...... Thank you KFC Anthea Large: I love this ad.  Have watched it countless times on tv and still get a good chuckle. Temani Lungu: This advert has to win an award. Basically most African Public Institutions described in 36's... Damn... Duduzile Tibane: kwaaaaaax, the system is offline... this is what we experience you know and I am laughing so hard right now Unoshamisa Chiradza: I literally stopped whatever I was watching so I could come find this advert funniest thing ever.
