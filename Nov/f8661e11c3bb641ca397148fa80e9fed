Cyber Monday, an online shopping day, means you still get to shop for discounted goods without having to leave your home or office. Loot.co.za digital marketing manager Alison Swain said Cyber Monday is quickly becoming one of the biggest online shopping days of the year. “Cyber Monday is the online world’s answer to Black Friday, so that e-tailers can make amazing online deals available to the public as well,” she said. Swain added that now that South Africa had taken to the global trend, the country had also jumped on the Cyber Monday bandwagon. But before you start your online shopping spree, make sure you do it safely. Account manager at F5 Networks Simon McCullough advised consumers to use well-established and trusted websites. Signs of flawed authenticity such as wording or formatting errors are symptomatic of fake websites. McCullough suggested customers only shop on locations that are encrypted, demonstrated by the “https” prefix in a retailer’s website and a padlock symbol in the browser. “It’s important to keep an eye out for phishing emails. “These usually appear to come from a well-known brand and ask for personal or financial information - something a retailer would never normally do. “Consumers should avoid retailers that ask for payments via money order, pre-loaded money card or wire, these are methods often associated with scammers,” he said. Some of the stores participating include: Makro, Takealot.com and Incredible Connection. Sunday Tribune
