Durban - SIX pupils have jetted off to represent South Africa in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030 conference in Germany. KZN Change Agents peer educators were selected from various high schools in Durban, and were nominated after impressing the judges with essays on the topic concerning ‘safety community in the city’. Grade 11 pupil Aaliyah Ndlovu, 17, of Mvaba High School, said she was excited to learn from other countries on how to deal with gender-based violence. “We need to find solutions in order to address the scourge. The knowledge learnt would assist my community to deal with famicide. Children rape is a huge challenge in our communities,” Ndlovu said. Another Grade 8 pupil Meli Madondo, 15, from Mqhawe Secondary School, said he would celebrate his sixteen birthday in Germany. He said the trip would empower him with various skills because Germany was a developed country with enormous experience in human rights issues. “I will be discussing issues of bullying and also talk about gender-based violence which has become a scourge in our communities,” he said. Mother Bongi Ndlovu said her son Khulekani Ndlovu, was concerned that the trip clashed with the final examinations but she was relieved that her son was going to be exposed to the world. Youth For Christ acting regional director Liz Govender said it was a wonderful opportunity for pupils to be exposed about other countries cultures. She said the non-profit organisation was established to empower the youth on issues HIV infection, sexual abuse, domestic violence and poverty. “I am so proud of this team and hope they will represent us well in Germany. They will come back empowered and implement safety and security measures in various schools and communities,” Govender said. Sunday Tribune
