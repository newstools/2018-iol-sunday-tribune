DURBAN - TWITTER was abuzz after NPA head Shaun Abrahams announced that former President Jacob Zuma's corruption, racketeering and money laundering charges would be reinstated. Zuma will get his day in court over 18 charges which include 780 counts of fraud, corruption, racketeering and money laundering. Last year, Zuma's former financial adviser, Schabir Shaik - who is out on medical parole, told the Sunday Tribune that he would turn State witness should Zuma stand trial on fraud and corruption charges.
