DURBAN - PRIVATE investigators who had been investigating the case of murdered Siam Lee were asked to leave the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday during a 29-year-old man’s bail application. Lee was murdered in January after she had been allegedly abducted from her Durban North home on Margaret Maytom Avenue. Her charred body was found in sugarcane in New Hanover, in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, two days after she went missing. Defence attorney Advocate Martin Krog, representing the accused, requested that Brad Nathanson and his team of private investigators be asked to leave the courtroom as they were potential witnesses in the case. Magistrate Mohamed Motala granted the request and the investigators left the courtroom. Nathanson - who was not in court - was among the private investigators who arrested the accused at his Hillcrest home in January. The accused faces charges of murder, rape and fraud among others. The accused was set to give his own testimony during the bail application, rather than submitting an affidavit to the court. Motala reminded the accused that anything he said during the application could be used against him later on in the trial. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
