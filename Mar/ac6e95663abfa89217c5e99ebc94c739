DURBAN - THE DURBAN Metro Police have appealed to residents for donations of suitable dogs to increase their operational capacity. The Metro Police said the dogs would help in their crime fighting efforts by improving the K9 Unit. The K9 unit uses trained dogs to combat crime which include illicit drug trade, sniff out drugs, locate dropped or concealed objects during criminal incidents. They also follow tracks of concealed objects during criminal incidents and chase criminals down. Metro Police spokesperson, Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad, said police dogs are used to provide both proactive and reactive services in the service. They are deployed for narcotic detection, explosive detection and tracking and apprehending of dangerous suspects. “The police unit works with German Sheperds, Rottweiler and Malinois breeds, and we are requesting the public to come forward should they have animals to donate. The dogs should be between nine months and three years old, be confident, energetic and not scared of people or loud noises. They should also be strong and have a good temperament,” he said in a statement. He explained that once contacted, Metro Police would make an appointment to assess the dog to establish whether the dog is suitable and if so, a contract would be signed. “Dogs are donated unconditionally to the Metro Police. Suitable dogs will be examined by the DMPS Veterinary Services, inoculated and tagged with a microchip. They will then be socialised and assessed to determine their suitability for K9 training. Trained dogs will be deployed operationally as a patrol dog. “The generosity and assistance of the public at large will be the key factor to determine the success of this donation drive and will contribute to ensuring the safety and security,” he added.
