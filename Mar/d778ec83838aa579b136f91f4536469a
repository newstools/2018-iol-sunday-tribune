Meanwhile, the court heard on Thursday that the accused tried to evade charges which were expected to be brought against him for releasing toxic fumes into the environment through his Johannesburg-based firm, Better Fuels. State prosecutor Surekha Marimuthu told the court that the businessman had evaded an official from the Department of Environmental Affairs. The accused’s advocate, Martin Krog, said in court that his client had been prejudiced and that the case had turned into a “civilian case”. During proceedings, the accused testified that he was a breadwinner who looked after his mother and brother, 14. He also told the court that 17 staff members he employed had not received an income due to his businesses being shut because of his arrest.

This led Motala to complain that the accused was delaying proceedings with his long, drawn-out responses. Details pertaining specifically to Lee’s abduction and murder are yet to emerge in court.
