  August 1, 2018  Mbhele said Thusi was also awarded a lifetime achievement award as a trumpeter by the Backing Vocalists and Session Musicians Awards (BVSM) in 2015, while he also founded a music centre for the historically disadvantaged youth of Durban in 1986 and was chosen to compose music and conduct the Haringey Youth Orchestra in North London 2000 and 2001, and the Oslo Youth Wind Ensemble in Norway, 2002. The family said he started playing brass instruments at the age of 10 after receiving lessons from his father and was formally introduced to jazz at Ohlange High School, by his principal. ‚ÄúHe identified jazz talent in him. He played trumpet for the school jazz group. He played trumpet, flugel horn, trombone, harmonica and sings efficiently,‚Äù said Mbhele. In his lifetime, he has performed all over the world with the KZN Philharmonic Orchestra, Namibia‚Äôs National Symphony Orchestra, Haringey Youth Orchestra (London) and North West Chamber Orchestra. He also performed and recorded music with industry greats including Mbongeni Ngema, Malcolm Darius Brubeck, Victor Ntoni, Lulu Gontsana, Kenny Baron, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Caiphus Semenya, Hugh Masekela, Sipho Gumede and many others. ‚ÄúAs a family, we find it hard to accept that he is gone. He was a loving husband, father, grandfather and community builder. He was very passionate about developing young talent and loved his craft, as he spent most of his time perfecting his talents. He will be sorely missed for his carefree attitude, always cracking jokes. He loved people, always socialising easily with anyone, no matter what social status they occupied,‚Äù said Mbhele, on behalf of the family. He is also survived by his children Mongezi, Songezi and Bahla, along with two siblings, three children and wife, Weziwe.
