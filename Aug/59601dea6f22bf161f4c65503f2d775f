DURBAN - FATHERS are a step closer to getting 10 days’ paid paternity leave, and more. THE Labour Laws Amendment Bill has been approved by the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), and has been sent to President Cyril Ramaphosa for a final sign-off. The Bill also includes provisions for 10 weeks’ parental adoption leave if the baby is under two years, this applied to one parent only; surrogacy leave; increased UIF; and maternity benefits. On Tuesday, Parliamentary spokesperson, Moloto Mothapo, released a statement which read that several bills had been approved by the NCOP, but still have another obstacle for final approval. “The Bills will now be sent to the president for assent. The National Assembly had earlier approved and referred these Bills to the NCOP, which has now approved them without amendment,” he said. These include the Labour Laws Amendment Bill (a Private Member’s Bill), the Basic Conditions of Employment Amendment Bill, the National Minimum Wage Bill and the Labour Relations Amendment Bill. Last year, history was made in Parliament when a private member's bill was passed for the first time in the National Assembly. At the time African Christian Democratic Party MP, Cheryllyn Dudley, who proposed the bill said: “The bill seeks to provide for parental leave, adoption leave and commissioning parental leave. It also provides for the payment of parental benefits as well as commissioning parental benefits from the Unemployment Insurance Fund." Meanwhile, the National Minimum Wage Bill, was also given the go ahead. This is a new Bill which the Minister of Labour introduced in November last year. It aims to provide for a National Minimum Wage, and to establish the National Minimum Wage Commission, with clear functions and composition. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
