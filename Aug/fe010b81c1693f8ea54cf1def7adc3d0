According to IPSS Rescueâ€™s Dylan Meyrick, two died at the scene while a third died in hospital. The condition of the other three people was critical. Mayrick said it was believed that a vehicle had a flat tyre and was parked in the fast lane on the N2 north-bound lane, when a family travelling in a light motor vehicle swerved to avoid the stationary vehicle, colliding with another. A foreign family travelling towards Durban, after a safari holiday, hit the swerving and oncoming vehicle.   The driver of the light motor vehicle died after paramedics arrived. A 12-year-old girl travelling in the SUV with her family was also declared dead at the scene. The father, mother and older brother all sustained critical injuries and were airlifted to Ethekwini Hospital. The mother succumbed to her injuries shortly after arrival at hospital. The driver of the SUV was trapped in the wreckage and required the fire department to use the jaws of life to free him, before he was taken to hospital. Meyrick said the freeway was closed in both directions, only opening again in the early evening. THE INDEPENDENT ON SATURDAY
