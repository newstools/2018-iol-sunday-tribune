DURBAN - A DURBAN nature lover has been honoured as the best geology student in the country. Kreesan Palan, 25, who graduated with his Master’s in Geology at the University of KwaZulu-Natal earlier this year has been conducting research on how the world’s marine systems work. Palan has been awarded with the Geological Society of South Africa’s (GSSA) John Handley Award. The John Handley Award was instituted by the GSSA in 2002 to recognise the best MSc thesis in Geology to be produced at a South African university in the year prior to the award. Palan specializes in marine geology and for his research explored the creatures within Cape Town’s submarine canyons, which are ‘valleys on the seabed’, he explained. This is not the first such prize for the young Geologist. In 2015, Palan received the GSSA’s Haughton Award for his Honours research, and in 2016, he received the DMT Kai Batla Prize for the best Honours student in Geological Sciences at UKZN at the annual College Awards Ceremony. At the time of his graduation, he told the Sunday Tribune that education was empowerment, and would alleviate the global warming crisis. “The human breed lacks education. People in power, at a municipal level for example, don’t have the scientific background to enforce legislative laws that will prevent the exploitation of natural resources. For example, beach sand is being exploited because of over-engineering, and we can prevent that,” he said. Palan plans to pursue a PhD in Geology. He acknowledged the role of supervisors, Professor Andrew Green and Dr Errol Wiles in guiding his studies. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
