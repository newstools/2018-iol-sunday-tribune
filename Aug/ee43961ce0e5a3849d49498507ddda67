DURBAN - THE South African Communist Party (SACP) in KwaZulu-Natal will hold its elective congress on Sunday in Pongola, northern KwaZulu-Natal. The position of provincial secretary is poised to be fiercely contested as there has been growing dissent against current secretary Themba Mthembu, who has held the position since 2002. Mthembu is also the MEC for Agriculture in the KZN government. Initially, the congress was expected to take place in July but was postponed owing to grievances lodged by some party members. Among the grievances forwarded, was Mthembu’s perceived ties with former President Jacob Zuma. The SACP was among the protagonists for the former president, who resigned in February, relinquishing power to President Cyril Ramaphosa. Mthembu came underfire from some quarters in the SACP when he invited Zuma to his budget speech in his capacity as the MEC for Agriculture in KZN. Despite the backlash, Mthembu stood by his decision. Party insiders said members including Khayelihle Nkwanyana, who was previously Mthembu's spokesperson, were being lobbied to challenge Mthembu. About 400 voting delegates are expected to attend the congress which will elect new leadership which would lead the party for a period of three years. Mathews Ndlovu, SACP’s first deputy secretary in KZN, said it was all systems go for the congress. He said the congress would be addressed by national leaders including Blade Nzimande, the party’s general-secretary. Ndlovu said the national leadership had been handling the nomination process, adding that he was not privy to the names that have been brought forward. The current leadership was led by former eThekwini mayor, James Nxumalo as the chairperson. He is deputised by Nomvuzo Shabalala, who also deputised him as mayor of eThekwini Municipality.
