The report, which was leaked and has yet to be made public, said the state should pay for private security for the pair, both ANC members. The two testified during the Moerane Commission that former ANC Youth League secretary-general Sindiso Magaqa was killed because of his stand against corruption. The commission, which was tasked with investigating political killings in KwaZulu-Natal, handed its report to Premier Willies Mchunu in June. Cele’s spokesperson, Reneilwe Serero, said the minister had “serious reservations” about the findings and the remedial actions recommended by Mkhwebane. Zulu and Stuta were close friends of Magaqa, who was shot last year and later died in hospital.They lifted the lid on fraud and corruption in the Umzimkhulu Municipality which they believed led to Magaqa's assassination. At the time of his death, Magaqa was an ANC PR councillor. Zulu said he was hurt, disappointed and felt betrayed by the state. “I have a very good relationship with the minister as a person. However, my concern is that he may be ill-advised on the matter," he said. "Reviewing the report could take up to nine months to a year. Will we still be alive to tell the tale? If the state is failing to protect its witnesses, something is wrong with our justice system.” Stuta agreed, saying: “Justice has to be served, but clearly the state is not willing to do that.” KZN violence monitor Mary de Haas said Cele’s intentions were disturbing, and the pair were in a highly vulnerable state.
