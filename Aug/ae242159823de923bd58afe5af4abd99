Durban - There is yet another twist in the murder of Shallcross youngster Sadia Sukhraj who was killed outside her grandparents house in May. Police in KwaZulu-Natal have now said there is insufficient evidence to believe there ever was a third suspect in the case that was initially reported as a botched hijacking. At the time of the incident, three men were thought to have been involved in the incident where a vehicle was stolen as Sadia’s father, Pastor Shalendra Sukhraj, dropped off the little girl’s brother at her grandparents house. One suspect was shot dead as Sukhraj and an off duty officer tried to stop the criminals fleeing, while another accused, Sibonelo Mkhize, was arrested at the scene. Acting KZN provincial commissioner, Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, told the Daily News the story of a third suspect in the Sadia Sukhraj case may have been fabricated. Mkhwanazi said Mkhize told police that he and his deceased accomplice had been dropped off in Shallcross on the morning of the attack by another car, but there were no witnesses to attest to this, he said. Upon interrogation, Mkhize revealed names and addresses of the third suspect, but police found that the third suspect did not exist. NOW LISTEN This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. In May, when Police Minister Bheki Cele was in Durban, he told journalists police were aware of a third suspect and knew who he was. "It's only a matter of time before we pick him up. He won't have many suppers left outside prison ," Cele said at the time. At the time, arrests for the third suspect were described as “imminent” by the police. Police are yet to reveal whose gun killed the little girl. DAILY NEWS
