Durban - Three men have been arrested for theft following a high-speed chase through Durban that culminated in a carÂ crash on Tuesday. Kyle Van Reenen, a spokesperson for Marshall Security, said that shortly after 4 pm a white Volkswagen Polo matching the registration and description of a vehicle sought by the police was spotted travelling on the M4 Ruth First Highway towards Durban. "Marshall Security members attempted to stop the vehicle and an attempt to evade arrest the suspects branched off at the Riverside Road off-ramp fleeing towards uMgeni Road," he said. Van Reenen said a high-speed chase in pursuit of the car ensued. The driver of the Polo, he said, disregarded the safety of other road users and drove contra-flow, before turning up Argyle Road and onto Musgrave Road. The car collided with another motorist at the intersection of Musgrave Road and Clyde Avenue. "Three male suspects were arrested on scene and remanded into the custody of the South African Police Services for further investigation and processing," he said. Property confirmed to have been stolen in a theft out of a motor vehicle in the Umhlanga Rocks area on Tuesday, was recovered in the boot of the vehicle. Van Reenen said the suspects are also wanted in connection with an attempted theft of motor vehicle case in the uMhlanga Village area. Daily News
