DURBAN - A foreign national who defrauded a “friend” of more than R20 000 was remanded in custody after his appearance at the Durban Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on Wednesday. King Ngbanda Koto allegedly befriended the victim into giving him money claiming there was a flight from DRC carrying computers with his money. At first, he requested R5000 which he said he needed to pay SARS customs. A number of days later, he requested R26 000 and told the victim he needed to release the package. The victim gave him the money. The suspect was arrested by the Hawks this week when he tried to dupe the victim into giving him more money. He had claimed this time, that he had a gadget to produce money. Hawks Spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said the suspect visited the victim’s office carrying a gadget which he plugged and produced fakes notes. “He had in his possession a box containing a gadget, he then plugged the said gadget into an electrical socket and fed apparent fake bank notes which reportedly turned into what seemed like real bank notes amounting to approximately R1700.00 (in denominations of R100.00 notes)”. “He informed the victim that he can make more genuine money by converting the fake notes money but he needed R230 000.00 more for airtime. The victim then contacted the police for assistance and Koto was arrested,” said Mhlongo. The case was postponed to August 29 this year. The police are requesting people who have fallen victim to come forward by contacting Captain Ajith Jaganath @ 071 481 2631.
