DURBAN - THE Durban High Court has ordered the eThekwini Municipality to reinstate two companies that were recently blacklisted by the city. The companies had been implicated in a multimillion Rand scandal within the city. The companies, Uhlanga Trading Enterprise CC and Magubane Plant and Contractors CC, were blacklisted recently following a report by the City Integrity and Investigations Unit (CIIU). The CIIU report contained damning findings, including that the companies allegedly committed irregular practices. Among recommendations were for a case of fraud to be instituted against both Uhlanga Trading Enterprise CC and Magubane Plant and Contractors CC, and for the companies to be blacklisted from further business with the city. In February, both companies were among those paid to build toilets, but never delivered. At the time, the Sunday Tribune reported that R36.1 million was flushed down the drain after two senior officials at eThekwini Municipality allegedly authorised pre-payment to four companies that failed to supply toilet facilities to impoverished communities, including KwaXimba, Cato Ridge and KwaNyuswa. The companies refuted the allegations. Since the CIIU report, a court interdict has been sought and granted by the Durban High Court pending a review of the city’s decision to blacklist them. The city is opposing the appeal. "The upliftment of the blacklisting means that the municipality cannot disqualify these entities from doing business with the city. The city is opposing the appeal lodged by the companies for the court to review the decision to blacklist them,” the municipality’s statement read. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
