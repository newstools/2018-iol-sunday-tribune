Durban - It’s been 42 days since the Sydenham boy, Miguel Louw, went missing. His alleged kidnapper is set to appear at the Durban Magistrates Court on Wednesday. Miguel, 9, was allegedly kidnapped while walking home from Rippon Road School. Since his disappearance, a 43-year-old man, who is known to the family, has been arrested and was initially charged with kidnapping. The charge has since been changed to human trafficking. He will appear at the Durban Magistrates Court on Wednesday, where previously, while heading to the docks he whispered to Magistrate Mohamed Motala that he “did not do this”. At one of the previous court appearances, Miguel’s mother, Raylene, could be seen crying in court, demanding the accused to tell her where her child was.     Video footage at a local KFC take-away, shows that Miguel was last seen in the company of an unidentified male. Police have since turned their investigation towards Port Shepstone, where Miguel was said to have been spotted by community members. The family have since offered a R50 000 reward for information about the little boy's whereabouts. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
