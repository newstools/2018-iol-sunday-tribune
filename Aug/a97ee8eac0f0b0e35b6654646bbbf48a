Durban - If you’ve had a particularly bad cough while suffering from the flu, you could have been one of the many people badly affected by “pertussis”, otherwise known as whooping cough. The National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) reported that there has been an increase in confirmed cases of whooping cough among children under the age of five, across the country. “Pertussis, commonly known as ‘whooping cough’ is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by Bordetella pertussis and is notifiable according to the Health Act. An increase in pertussis cases has been reported from sites in kZN, Western Cape, Gauteng, Mpumalanga, and North West. Of the seven pertussis cases identified between May and July 2018, 20 (54%) were aged under three months. These sites form part of a pneumonia surveillance programme. “Clinicians are advised to be on the alert for cases, to conduct diagnostic testing where appropriate, to notify cases and prescribe postexposure prophylaxis to close and high-risk contacts of suspected or confirmed cases,” said the NICD in a statement.
