DURBAN - SBU Mpisane has appealed to the public to carry on praying for his daughter Sbahle, who remains in a critical condition at a Durban hospital two weeks after her crash on Margaret Mncadi Avenue (Victoria Embankment). Sbahle, the popular fitness enthusiast, was driving in her BMW 4 Series when she crashed into a tree in the early hours of August 9. Firefighters had to use the jaws of life to free her from the burning car. “We would like to thank all her supporters and all people who have given the family moral support through this tough time for the family,” the father told Isolezwe. “We still need your prayers for Sbahle to recover fully, because with your prayers, God will hear us,” said Sbu Mpisane. Mpisane said Sbahle remained in a critical condition, but there was marked improvement. He previously revealed to IOL that Sbahle had suffered multiple fractures to her legs and arms. “If you look at that accident picture, she should not have made it,” said Sbu Mpisane at the time. The latest, he said, was that Sbahle was in and out of operations and could still not talk. Meanwhile, Sbahle’s sports star boyfriend, Itumeleng Khune, her fitness partness Yolanda Sokhela, friends and fans of Sbahle took part in a workout session in her honour at the University of KwaZulu-Natal.  Gospel musician and pastor, Khaya Mthethwa, led a prayer service at the same event. Police are investigating a case of reckless and negligent driving over the accident. DAILY NEWS
