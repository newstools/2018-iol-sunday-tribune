Her teachings include; global history, women, gender and politics and culture and tourism. About staging the lecture Professor Johannes Smith from UKZN's School of Religion and Theology said: “This year is the 70th year of the commemoration of the death of Gandhi. We thought that, since Gandhi has such an important link to South Africa, we should organise an event on this. Further, Gandhi coined the term satyagraha, here in South Africa, in the early 1900s, and also since it had such an important impact internationally, for instance on the liberation struggles within the colonies in the 1950s, on Dr Martin Luther King Jnr, and also on our own President Nelson Mandela. We decided to commemorate this event, by combining it with our Annual ASRSA Congress, which is also the 40th year of its existence.” SUNDAY TRIBUNE
