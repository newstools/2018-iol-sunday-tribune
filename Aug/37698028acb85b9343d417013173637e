ANC KZN secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli said it was a sad day for the province. "To the ANC, Sir Bubzin was not just a producer but he was part of us. He was among many musicians who form part of the ANC ambassadors. He has left a huge void, not only to his biological family, music industry but to many of us. It is a great loss as Bubzin still had a bright future ahead of him,” said Ntuli. DAILY NEWS
