DURBAN - A 58-year-old woman is facing charges of being in possession of illegal firearms and ammunition, at the Weenen Magistrates Court, northern KwaZulu-Natal. KZN police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said on Wednesday that the woman was arrested on Tuesday following an intelligence driven operation, in which police found two rifles and 42 rounds of ammunition. "The operation was held in the Weenen area by the Ladysmith K9 Unit. The members went to a house in Ngodindi area, Weenen, where they recovered two rifles and 42 rounds of ammunition. These firearms will be subjected to ballistic testing," said Gwala. On the same day in Harburg, police arrested several robbery suspects. At 8:30am, a businessman was approached by seven unidentified gun-wielding suspects at his business premises in Efaye. "At gunpoint, the suspects tied the victim with cable ties and ransacked the business premises. They took cigarettes, airtime vouchers, airtime machine, cellphones and an undisclosed amount of cash before fleeing the scene in their getaway Nissan bakkie," said Gwala. Harburg police officers who responded to the scene, spotted the suspects’ vehicle and arrested four suspects. Gwala added: "The team gave chase and further three suspects were arrested. Three unlicensed 9mm pistols with 40 rounds of ammunition were confiscated from the suspects. The vehicle that was used in the commission of crime was also confiscated for further investigation." The suspects are expected to appear at the New Hanover Magistrates’ Court on charges of robbery, possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition later this week. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
