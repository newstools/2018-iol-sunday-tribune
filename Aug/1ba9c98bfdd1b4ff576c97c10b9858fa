Otto Volek Road links the New Germany industrial area and the newly completed Dumisani Makhaye highway. In the same vicinity, the construction of the GO! Durban project, the city’s integrated rapid transport system, was under way. A parent, Mbali Mbedu, said: “The closest school is across the road that’s why we desperately need assistance from the municipality to build us the bridge. Our children’s lives are in danger as they have to walk across the road by themselves every day when they go to school.” The residents’ fears were heightened by a July incident in which a pupil was knocked down by a car. The pupil sustained serious injuries. “We have requested the municipality to assist with a scholar patrol for the safety of our kids but nothing has happened,” she said. Another parent, Nokwanda Mbambo, said she had been told by a metro police officer it was impractical to have a scholar patrol on Otto Volek Road because there were no pedestrians crossing marks. “We were told that the road is classified as a highway and no speed humps or traffic light could be erected. Since there is ongoing construction we are pleading with the city to consider building a pedestrian bridge for our safety. “It is not only kids; we also have to cross the highway to get the taxis across the road,” said Mbambo. City Watch witnessed pupils crossing the highway, one of the busiest during peak time, to school by themselves. With Go! Durban construction under way, pupils were forced to jump over concrete barriers to get to schools. The city did not respond by the time of going to press. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
