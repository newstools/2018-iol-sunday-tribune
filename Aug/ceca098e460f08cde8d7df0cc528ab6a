DURBAN - THERE’S a month to go before the biggest global cleanup event that the world has ever witnessed takes place on World Cleanup Day, on September 15 this year. The Saturday event will see more than 150 countries around the world mobilize to pick up litter, and make the world a better, cleaner place. It is estimated that each year, 8 million tonnes of litter end up in the environment causing a serious threat to people, wildlife, soil, water and air. Approximately 80% of ocean litter is derived from land based waste. The World Cleanup Day will begin in New Zealand, where the September 15th sun rises. The campaign will move around the globe with the time zones, and will end in Hawaii 36 hours later. South Africa is one of 60 African countries participating in this year’s event. The Mzansi leg of the international campaign was launched in Cape Town last week as a start-off beach clean up on Milnerton’s Woodbridge Island. The United Nations Environment Executive Director, Erik Solheim, described South Africa’s shores as among the most beautiful in the world. He urged residents to protect the country’s environment. “South Africa is doing great and it is fantastic to see so many people being mobilized. Your country has some of the most beautiful beaches in the world and has a very long coastline. However, more needs to be done. We see the problem of litter on the beaches and marine environment all over the world. The good news is humans created this problem, but we can definitely solve it too.  We need to clean the beaches and keep them beautiful, but we also need to stop the garbage coming from the source,” Solheim said.
