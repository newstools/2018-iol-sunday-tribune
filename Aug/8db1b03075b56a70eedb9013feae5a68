DURBAN - THE father of the 9-year-old Sydenham boy, Miguel Louw, has not given up hope that he will once again be reunited with his son who went missing more than a fortnight ago. Miguel’s father, Kirk Louw, pleaded with anyone with information to come forward. “If you have any information, please, let us know,” he said. Miguel was last seen talking to a man outside KFC in Sydenham on July 17 in the presence of a man. He has not been seen since. Louw had a message for his son: “Miguel if you are watching this, please, you know that mummy, daddy, your sister and everyone in the family, loves you, please come home,” he said. “I still look through the window and hope that he would soon walk through the gate at our home,” said Louw.

A 43-year-old man, who is known to the boy’s mother, Raylene, was arrested and faces abduction and human trafficking charges at the Durban Regional Court. Louw said the pain of having a child missing was “unbearable”. “Another time, I saw a boy that looked like Miguel through the window at home. I raced out towards him. When I got outside, I realised it was not my son,” he said. Miguel’s mother, Raylene, became emotional during Monday's court session and started yelling at the accused, who stood on the dock. She burst into tears and yelled at the accused standing in the dock: “Tell me where’s my child! Tell me where’s my son, you psycho!,” before a court orderly asked her to reign in her emotions. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said the search for Miguel continued. “Anyone with information of his whereabouts is urged to contact Captain Maphumulo on 083 979 7422, Sydenham police 031 203 2707 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111,” said Mbele.
