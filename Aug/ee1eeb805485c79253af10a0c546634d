DURBAN - The Indian flag stands tall at the India House in Morningside, Durban, where India Independence Day celebrations got underway on Wednesday. India is celebrating 72 years of independence from British colonial rule. Durban, which is home to the largest number of Indians outside of India, raised the Indian national flag at India House on Wednesday as the Indian Consulate General, Dr Shashank Vikram, hosted VIP guests to the prestigious function. In India, Independence Day, a national holiday, was celebrated with Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, announcing his flagship health policy. The Indian Express reported that Modi’s Ayushman Bharat or National Health Protection Scheme aims to cover millions of families across India who do not have access to healthcare. The scheme will be rolled out on September 25. Modi, who was speaking at the Red Fort Castle, also announced the much demanded permanent commission for women in armed forces. So far women were given short service commission in Army, Navy and Air Force. Meanwhile Bollywood superstars took to social media to celebrate the Independence of their country.          #HappyIndependenceDay India. #JaiHind A post shared by  Priyanka Chopra (@priyankachopra) on Aug 15, 2018 at 12:37am PDT            Happy Independence day! @manushi_chhillar #manushi #manushichhillar #independenceday #happyindependenceday A post shared by  www.beautypageants.in (@missindiaorg) on Aug 15, 2018 at 5:51am PDT      Our young nation 🌍 is the very future of the world !!!!! #HappyIndependenceDay 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 @NavbharatTimes A post shared by  Ranveer Singh (@ranveersingh) on Aug 14, 2018 at 7:31pm PDT     I love my country!
