DURBAN - AFTER reducing its energy consumption by 30%, the Volkswagen Group South Africa (VWSA) has been awarded with the SJM Flex Environmental Award for the sixth time. The group scooped the award at the 2018 Exporters Eastern Cape Club Awards recently. This specific category recognises exporters that pursue excellence in environmental management and are ISO 14001 accredited. In 2015, an international scandal came to light dubbed the ‘diesel dupe’ according to the BBC. At the time, the carmaker admitted to fitting 11 million vehicles worldwide with "defeat devices" - software designed to trick regulators into thinking cars met emissions standards. In fact, output of harmful fine particulates and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which can cause respiratory and heart diseases, was far higher than legally permitted. VW was then called upon to pay a one billion euro (R15.5bn) fine imposed by German prosecutors for diesel emissions cheating. But in 2010 the South African VW group made substantial changes at the workplace. VWSA introduced an environmental programme, ‘Think.Blue Factory’ which was aimed at reducing environmental footprint at its manufacturing factory in Uitenhage. The programme focussed on five main areas, Energy, Waste, Water, CO2 and Solvent Emissions. By 2017, VWSA managed to reduce its energy consumption by 30%, CO2  by 28%, solvent emissions by 31% per vehicle produced. Water consumption was reduced by 54% and waste generation per vehicle dropped by 64%. Thomas Schaefer, the chairman and managing director of the Volkswagen Group South Africa: "This award is a recognition of our environmental programmes and it emphasizes our continuous efforts in being a responsible corporate citizen.” SUNDAY TRIBUNE
