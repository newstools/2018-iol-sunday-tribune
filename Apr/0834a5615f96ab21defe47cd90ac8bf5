An SABC journalist is heard saying: “There’s Mr Nelson Mandela, a free man, taking his first steps into a new South Africa. Mrs Winnie Mandela next to him, waving to the crowds. Hand in hand, they leave the Victor Verster Prison."   4. When she watched Madiba breath for the last time Shortly after Nelson Mandela passed away in December 2013, aged 95, Madikizela-Mandela exclusively spoke to a British news channel iTV News. Dressed in black clothing, still in mourning, Madikizela-Mandela who had divorced Mandela in 1995, said she waited at his bedside for three hours before Mandela passed away in her presence. "I consider myself very blessed to be there when he drew his last breath," she said.   5. When the girls just had fun In 2013, Destiny Magazine, published a video featuring it's January cover stars, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and British actress Naomi Harris. The feature came as the pair promoted the British-South African biographical film Nelson Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom in which Harris played a young Winnie Madikizela. In the video, Madikizela-Mandela and Harris enjoy a photoshoot session together, with Madikizela-Mandela applauding Harris' portrayal of her in the movie. She said: "This is the first time it's [the story] is told correctly, and it's brutality exposed as it was. It is not easy to look at yourself and interpret what you went through, unless you are asked, because you tend to bury such experiences in the subconsciousness mind which is what I have done throughout the years."   Madikizela-Mandela added: "I've always been part of this huge movement. I'm just a little screw in that huge machine that fought for the liberation of our people." But, earlier this week while announcing plans for her national official funeral, Ramaphosa said: "Winnie Mandela leaves a huge legacy. And as we say in African culture, a gigantic tree has fallen. And this is the Winnie Mandela tree that provided shade for the people in South Africa." SUNDAY TRIBUNE
