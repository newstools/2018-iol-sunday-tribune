Durban - The search for a missing teenager got underway in the waters surrounding Blythedale beach this morning. The youngster was swimming at the beach, on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast at around 5pm, when he got into difficulty and was swept away, further out to sea. The 16-year-old is from  Gledhow, near Stanger. IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson, Paul Herbst, said an off-duty policeman alerted them to the scene yesterday. “The IPSS water rescue division, together with KDM lifeguards, responded to the beach and initiated an extensive search. The search was suspended with negative results, due to poor light,” Herbst said. The search resumed this morning. “Four vessels have been launched this morning and beach patrols are also being conducted in the area. The search patterns have begun from both the north and south sides but with no results. A drone has also been launched to help with the search,” he said. Daily News
