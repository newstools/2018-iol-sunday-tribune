DURBAN - THE body of an 11-year-old autistic boy who went missing on Tuesday has been found floating in a swimming pool on Wednesday. Simangaliso Madula disappeared from the Inqolobane Children’s Home in KwaDukuza, north of Durban. Spokesperson Sergeant Clinton Odayar said Madula’s body was found by members of the Umhlali K9 Unit in close proximity of the house. "His body has been found and the police have opened an inquest docket,” said Odayar. The community had rallied together to search for the boy since he went missing on Tuesday. Chairperson of the Inqolobane Children’s Home, Kenneth Mthunzi said he was still in shock. “I am devastated to hear the news, the home is fenced and has two gates which are managed by security guards. It’s unclear how he went out as the gates are always locked, even the guards said they didn't see him leaving,” said Mthunzi on Wednesday. “On Tuesday, we searched for Smanga everywhere with the police including dams around the area. I am just confused as to how his body has been found in the swimming pool when we couldn’t find anything there yesterday, it’s just mysterious,” said Mthunzi. Mthunzi said the boy’s family was devastated. “Smanga was living at Inqolobane full time, his grandmother lives at Mandeni and they used to take him for few days when they could. After being reported he was missing, the grandmother arrived and searched with everyone, she too was confused and broken,” he said. Mthunzi said they would be investigating how the boy left the home.
