DURBAN - GETTING online is the matter of a click of a button for many people living in the city. But youth in Hambanathi, near Tongaat, have been made to travel long distances just to get access to the web. But this is about to change. The eThekwini Municipality is set to unveil 37 computers to be donated to a state-of-the-art computer centre in the region, north of Durban. “The Computer Centre of Excellence is generally a multipurpose facility which will assist the community to type their curriculum vitae (CVs), search for employment opportunities from eThekwini Municipality and any other organisations,” said the municipality’s acting spokesperson, Mandla Nsele. Nsele said young people in the area often had to travel long distances to get access to a computer and the internet where they could search for job opportunities and prepare their CV’s. They also had to pay for these services. “The centre will permanently bring information technology (IT) to the doorsteps of this community who for years endured parting with money to access these much needed services,” he said. eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede is set to open the facility on Wednesday afternoon at the township’s community hall.
