Research has suggested that dagga- users are more likely to become schizophrenic and the project director at Doctors for Life, Johan Claassen, said cannabis could impair cognitive function, leading to poor school performance and diminished achievements. Last month, to the disapproval of mental health practitioners, the private use of cannabis was legalised. Operational manager at the RKKhan Hospital psychiatry ward, Reena Dawood, said irrespective of a person’s mental health, they should not be using dagga because it could result in brain damage in the long run. “Dagga use offers temporary happiness which gives the user the illusion that they have control of their mental issues, then in the long run they end up with a more chronic mental illness. Dawood said the legalising of dagga was a step backwards in the work done in combating mental illness. “Mental illness is the orphan child of the public health-care system. It does not seem to be a priority.” Instead of the government legalising dagga, the focus should be on providing sufficient and important mental health treatment at public clinics and hospitals for the many people who came seeking help. “Because mental illnesses are not tackled with the urgency they deserve, we often prescribe and give patients medication, and when they come back to the hospital they find that it has run out of that medication.” Durban private psychiatrist Dr Hemant Nowbath said the new law might lead to greater abuse of cannabis, increase rates of addiction and aggravate the myriad medical, psycho- social and psychiatric problems caused by cannabis. “In a country marked by economic disparity, the vulnerable will be more affected by these problems,” he said.
