Some of the projects on display included the design of a low-cost autonomous mobile security robot, designed and manufactured by students Simeon Roach, Curtley Brandon Govender, Deandra Maxine Joseph and Sakiseni Nzuza. The robot was designed to be used in a factory or warehouse setting with the focus being on surveillance. Through the design of an autonomous navigation system, wireless communication network and visual intruder detection, it was possible to put together a working prototype design. Students also designed an archery device for use by quadriplegic athletes, a device that creates the illusion of fruit growing on trees, and an electric transporter powered by solar energy. The projects, which were part of the degree requirements of the final-year design and research project modules have applications for the agricultural, sanitation, construction, airline, search and rescue, manufacturing, and transport sectors. The process of completing these design projects simulates a professional working environment in which students have to apply the engineering knowledge gained during their studies to achieve specified project objectives while keeping within predetermined budgets.
