Slavko Yaskin, 29, known as Kaka, spent more than a month exploring northern KwaZulu-Natal before he disappeared. He was last seen on September 25 in Dundee, 300km north-west of Durban, where he stayed at a Christian mission house before he left for Underberg. Pastor Peter Hambridge, with whom he stayed, said he met Yaskin by chance while he was passing the mission. “We work with homeless people. He came to us on the evening of September 20 and stayed for the weekend. “He was fine, and well-equipped for camping. He said he had travelled throughout South Africa and even slept on the streets in Hillbrow.” Hambridge said Yaskin was employed, earned money and felt he needed to explore life. Yaskin was meant to have boarded a flight back home this week. His family have tasked IRS Forensic Investigations to search for him. Investigator Chad Thomas said Yaskin had hiked throughout the province and stayed “with anyone”. “He fell in love with the African culture and was travelling to different parts of northern KZN to learn as much as he could. He wanted to stay with the people and learn about their culture, he even took a bath in the river for the experience. “He chatted with his family often, and when he stopped communicating, his family became worried. “He didn’t board the flight and the family are now devastated. We are calling on the public to report any information they may have.” He said there is an undisclosed reward to be given to anyone with information regarding Yaskin. A missing person’s report has been filed with the police, but the Sunday Tribune was unable to confirm this at the time of going to print.
