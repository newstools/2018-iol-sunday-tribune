Durban - Today, scores of people were injured in road accidents across the province. From minor fender benders to more serious crashes, there are teams of people who rush to scenes and often put their own lives in danger just to save the lives of those who are unable to fend for themselves in that moment. Most of the time, these men and women go unnoticed. They are the unsung heroes of our community. And on #WorldTraumaDay, we commemorate the trauma teams who deal with life-and-death situations on a daily basis.  In honour of the sterling work done by emergency and trauma teams, Life Entabeni Hospital staged a car crash demonstration with the aim of demonstrating how the trauma teams work together.

Marketing and communications coordinator at Life Entabeni, Lara Richards, said; "The demonstration showed a life-threatening emergency where two people were entrapped in a mangled vehicle. The Jaws of Life and other hydraulic equipment was used to extricate the patients while scene safety was maintained and while the paramedics intervened with life-saving support."  Richards said the team will then demonstrate how a patient is loaded into an ambulance and handed over the trauma staff at the hospital.  Despite the rain this morning, the teams worked fervently to rescue the "injured" patients. We honour our men and women of trauma units across SA. Daily News
