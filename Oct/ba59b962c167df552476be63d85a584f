DURBAN - A nursing agency which provides the Mediclinic hospital group with nurses fired a nurse who made light of rape victim Cheryl Zondi’s testimony on Tuesday in a social media post. The nurse, Ivy Masuku, was fired on Wednesday after screenshots of her comments circulated late on Tuesday night. On her Facebook profile, Masuku lists the Mediclinic Muelmed hospital in Pretoria as her place of employment. The woman had allegedly made disparaging remarks on social media in relation to Zondi’s testimony at the Port Elizabeth on Tuesday.      @Mediclinic This lady's profile says she works for your hospital in Secunda. What's your take on her shaming rape victims - are we even safe in her hands if she can writes such things. I'm disgusted!!! #CherylZondi #OmotosoTrial #Rape #TimothyOmotoso pic.twitter.com/CIpWwDVZ6E  — Bee (@PettyBetty18) 
  October 16, 2018  Social media had been full of praise for Zondi’s courage, strength and bravery to face up to Omotoso’s defence lawyer, Peter Dauberman, who has been cross-examining Zondi in the trial where Omotoso stands accused of 63 charges, including rape and human trafficking in the Port Elizabeth High Court. The 58-year-old televangelist allegedly trafficked more than 30 girls and women who were from various branches of his church to a house in Umhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal, where he allegedly sexually exploited them. The nurse wrote on Facebook and made light of Zondi’s testimony. “They must stop upsetting us, you had sex you had sex,” said Masuku, in a post loosely translated from isiZulu. Another woman, Nompumelelo Sithole, said Zondi and the other women had seduced Omotoso. A loose translation of her post read: “We were not there when they were seducing him, they must not involve us”. In a statement on social media, Mediclinic said the woman had been fired by the nursing agency that she worked for. Mediclinic refused to disclose the name of the nursing agency. The hospital group said it had launched an investigation into the matter, with the support of the unnamed nursing agency. “Mediclinic confirm that the staff member in question is no longer in the employ of the nursing agency and that the individual has been requested to remove all associations with the organisation effective immediately,” said Mediclinic in a statement posted on Twitter. The statement was verified by Mediclinic’s social media engineer, Lee-Ann Bell. Pressed for further questions on Wednesday, Bell said the nurse in question was not in the employ of Mediclinic and as such: “Mediclinic cannot comment on the matter and distances itself from the views expressed by the individual”. She said Mediclinic would not comment further on the matter. Meanwhile, social media users said the woman had shamed rape victims.  This is Ivy Masuku, a Nurse at MediClinic Meulmed Hospital in Pretoria and Nompumelelo Sithole, taking turns to shame Tim Omotoso's Rape Victims, including Cheryl Zondi.This is why many others die in silence because even hospital staff, shames rape victims.
