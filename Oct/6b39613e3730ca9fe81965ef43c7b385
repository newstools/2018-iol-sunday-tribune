Durban - Fancy seasoning your food with some pepper, salt and teeny microplastics? It may not sound that appetising, but that is what we could be ingesting as researchers have found that some salt brands around the world, contain microplastics. Greenpeace International, and Incheon University in South Korea, found that microplastics have found their way into some of the salt that people are eating. Salt brands in Indonesia were found to have the highest levels of microplastics, while in Africa, some brands in Senegal were found to contain microplastics. “Recent studies have found plastics in seafood, wildlife, tap water, and now in salt. It’s clear that there is no escape from this plastics crisis, especially as it continues to leak into our waterways and oceans,” said Mikyoung Kim, campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia. “We need to stop plastic pollution at its source. For the health of people and our environment, it’s incredibly important that corporations reduce their reliance on throwaway plastics immediately,” she said. Researchers said assuming the average adult consumes 10 grams per day of salt, so 2 000 microplastics could possibly be ingested each year. “The findings suggest that human ingestion of microplastics via marine products is strongly related to plastic emissions in a given region,” said Professor Kim, Seung-Kyu, corresponding author of the study. “In order to limit our exposure to microplastics, preventative measures are required, such as controlling the environmental discharge of mismanaged plastics and more importantly, reducing plastic waste,” he said.
