Durban - Police believe that the elderly man found dead in his Pietermaritzburg home was strangled. Initial reports of the gruesome Wednesday morning said the elderly man had been found in a pool of blood. "On arrival (at the scene), police found the body of a 94-year-old man lying on the floor with strangulation marks," said police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane. "He was certified dead on the scene." Zwane said that a white VW Polo car was taken from his garage and that other items were also stolen. He said Alexandra Road SAPS was investigating case of house robbery and murder. The identity of the man was yet to be released. The incident comes three months after three elderly people were murdered at neighbouring old age homes in the provincial capital. In August, the Pietermaritzburg Regional Court sentenced Kershwin Goldstone to three life terms for the murder and robbery of Patrica Tugwell, Roland Heathcote and Patricia O'Connor, who were murdered at their Jacaranda Lodge Retirement Village when Goldstone jumped over a fence to gain entry. The deceased were all elderly - aged between 89 and 92. The Independent On Saturday
