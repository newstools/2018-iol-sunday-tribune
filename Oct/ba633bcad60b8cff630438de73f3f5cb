DURBAN - Police in Durban need help reuniting a mentally disturbed boy who was found at a Durban taxi rank with his parents. The boy, 11, was found wandering around at the Soldiers Way taxi rank in Durban on Monday afternoon. He was found wearing a black jersey and khaki pants by a taxi rank manager who took him to the police. It is believed that he is from the South Coast but police were still trying to locate his parents. He has been kept at the Durban Central police station until his relatives come forward. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said it was difficult to locate the boy’s parents because he could not articulate words properly and he is mentally disturbed. “When he was found he could not direct us to his parents. He gave us incomplete information like he would say his mother is Busi. His mind keeps wandering from one point to the next. But we suspect him to be from the South Coast in Umzumbe area. He calls himself Gxabhashe,” she said. Mbhele said police have also established that he was once admitted at Addington hospital some months ago. But the hospital could not provide his home address. Police have appealed anyone with information that might assist the police in the investigation to contact Detective Sergeant Nandipha Mbebe on 031 325 4541/071 845 8023 or Crime Stop number on 08600 10111.
