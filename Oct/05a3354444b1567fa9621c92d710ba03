The World Travel Awards (WTA) - recognised as the industry “Oscars” - were presented at a red carpet event at the Durban International Convention Centre last night. The ceremony, attended by leading personalities in the African and Indian Ocean travel industries, was the sixth leg of the WTA Grand Tour, an annual search for the finest travel and tourism organisations in the world. The ICC, which hosted the gathering, received the award for being Africa’s leading meetings and conference centre for the 17th time. Durban also took the trophy for being Africa’s leading city destination and for being Africa’s leading meetings and conference destination, while the Port of Durban received the honours for being Africa’s leading cruise port. It was the third time that the WTA had been held in the city. An ecstatic mayor Zandile Gumede said she was overwhelmed that the city had received so many honours, saying it was “because of our citizens, who are warm, welcoming and have the ubuntu spirit”. Visitors felt at home on the beaches, in the restaurants and at all the attractions, she said: “Durban is the place to be.” A beaming Lindiwe Rakharebe, chief executive of the Durban ICC, said she was “really excited” that the venue had once again received the coveted TWA honours for being Africa’s leading meetings and conference centre. “It’s our 21st anniversary year and receiving this WTA is the cherry on the top,” she said, thanking the ICC’s stakeholders and clients and her hard-working and capable staff.“We are open for business: let’s get more,” she said.
