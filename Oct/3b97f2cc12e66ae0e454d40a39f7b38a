Durban - A 35-year-old man received two life sentences for raping 2 teenagers in April 2016. Mzwandile Khomba Nxumalo was sentenced in the Mtunzini High Court this week. According to police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, Nxumalo had been operating a business transporting the local community to and from the Eshowe CBD. "On 1 April 2016, he took a 18-year-female from Maqhwakazi area who was going to Mandeni CBD and promised to take her to her destination. "He drove her around and veered off to the sugarcane field where he repeatedly raped her. He later took her to the CBD and the victim managed to take down the registration number of the bakkie. A case of rape was opened at Mandeni police station." Mbhele said later that month, the accused took his 19 year old neighbour who was going to the Eshowe CBD and raped her multiple times before dropping her off in the CBD. "The accused threatened both victims with a bush knife that he kept inside the bakkie. He was linked through DNA and an identification parade."
