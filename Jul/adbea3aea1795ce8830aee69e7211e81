Durban - Swim at your own risk. That’s the warning to beachgoers in KwaZulu-Natal this weekend as KZN Sharks Board workers aligned to The South African Liberating Public Sector Workers Union embarked on a strike on Friday. The strike has forced the KZN Sharks Board to remove the shark nets along the KZN coast. The Sharks Board oversees protection measures for 37 beaches from Richards Bay in the north to Port Edward in the south. According to the Sharks Board, the nets will be removed for the duration of the strike. In a statement, the Sharks Board said: “The duration of this strike action is unknown at this time and in an effort to ensure zero environmental impact all shark safety gear at protected beaches along the KZN coast has been temporarily removed. Bathers are requested to adhere to lifeguards recommendations and instructions at the beach. The board shall continue to negotiate with the Union in an effort to speedily resolve these matters”. The city of uMhlathuze - Richards Bay - urged people not to swim at the beaches which include the popular Alkantstrand Beach and Port Dunford. “The city of uMhlathuze is highly concerned about the safety of our beachgoers, bathers, fishers, water sports fanatics, general swimmers, tourists and any other person and shall take all possible measures to ensure that no one gets into the seawater until it is cleared,” Mdu Ncalane, spokesman for uMhlathuze Municipality said. “This comes at a crucial time where we are receiving a number of tourists from other parts of the country who are escaping winter from their places to enjoy our ever warm weather and cool temperatures. The city pleads with everyone to adhere to this precaution and our Beach Section and lifesavers will be deployed in their numbers to ensure no one is risking his or her life during this period,” he said.
