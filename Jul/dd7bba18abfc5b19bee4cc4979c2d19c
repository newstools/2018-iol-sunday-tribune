American hounds will be on the loose in the Greater Kruger National Park area shortly. Ten counter-poaching dogs, bred for tracking humans, have landed in South Africa and will be deployed to the private Greater Kruger areas to help fight poaching. The Redbone Coonhounds are the latest addition to the Southern African Wildlife College’s K9 Unit, and the first to be off-leash. The college is a non-profit conservation, education and development programme based near the park. “This pack has been trained as ‘free-running dogs’ meaning that they operate off-lead. By scent, they are trained to pick up human tracks, which they then follow for distances of up to 30km. All dogs are fitted with GPS collars so we can monitor them. With this pack being free-running, they will be able to track and find the suspects faster sometimes over rough terrain, and hold them at bay until the helicopters and law enforcement teams arrive at the scene to make arrests,” said Johan van Straaten, the SAWC’s K9 Unit Dog Master. The pack had been bred for over a century in the US to track humans for law enforcement purposes. The additional hounds have been described as tracker dogs by SAWC chief Theresa Sowry. “Adding tracker dogs to the field ranger teams has really changed the game, but as their successes increase, so too do the risks they face. They are real conservation heroes that complement the work being done by field rangers, through aerial support and within communities, as part of our four-tiered approach to counter-poaching.” SUNDAY TRIBUNE
