DURBAN - Glenwood service station owner Graeme Shewitz fears that the hike in the fuel price will increase crime levels at petrol stations when heavily burdened motorists cannot afford to pay for fuel. Shewitz, who owns the BP Moore Road service station, said the fuel hike did not benefit oil retailers and had an impact on business. He added that people wanting to boycott petrol stations with the aim of reversing fuel prices were ill-informed: “It hurts all of us. The higher the price of fuel, the less litres we sell.” Shewitz said the public needed to understand that the fuel price was driven by the exchange rate between the rand and dollar: “As the rand weakens against the dollar, we come under pressure because international oil is based on that currency.” Shewitz pointed out that the future looked bleak for petrol stations and he blamed high government taxes that caused the fuel price to sky-rocket. “Government taxes about 40% of petrol per litre. A higher petrol price is bad for the oil retail business. We do not get percentages; we only get cents, a little over R1, which still has to be split to pay for staff salaries and other running costs, including a R70000 electricity bill.” Shewitz said further hikes should be avoided as they would worsen the economy. He added that some petrol attendants could lose their jobs if more hikes were envisaged. He said that to avoid financial losses they would have to ask clients for an upfront payment before filling up.  nkululeko.nene@inl.co.za
