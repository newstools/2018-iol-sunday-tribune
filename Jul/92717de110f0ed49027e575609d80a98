DURBAN - A CALL has been made for intelligence gathering to be intensified in KwaZulu-Natal following a series of bomb threats in the province. This comes after another incendiary device had been found at a Woolworths Store in the Durban CBD earlier today. Chairperson of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Police, Mr Francois Beukman, said intensified intelligence gathering backed by proactive interventions needed to be introduced to deal with the recent spate of bomb threats as well as any hoax bomb threats. There had been at least six other bomb threats in the last two weeks. “Crime intelligence has to play a greater strategic role if this trend is to be curtailed. It is unacceptable that the people of South Africa are prevented from living their daily lives because of these threats. Police must ensure that people go about their daily chores without fear,” Beukman said. He called on members of the community to work with police to provide information so that these threats are stopped. He said the committee will invite police to give a detailed briefing on the bomb threats, as well as an update on various cases occurring at mosques around the country. Meanwhile, Woolworths spokesperson Kirsten Hewett confirmed an incendiary device had been found at the Dr Pixley KaSeme (West Street) store on Thursday morning. “As a precautionary measure, we immediately evacuated the store in order to ensure the safety of our people and our customers. Authorities have been called in to investigate,” said Hewett. She said the brand had been shocked by the recent incidents in KZN, both within Woolworths stores as well as in the broader community. “We have already put in place numerous protection and detection measures to ensure the safety of our people and our customers. We are working closely with the SAPS, the Hawks and our own internal investigators on this matter,” said Hewett. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
