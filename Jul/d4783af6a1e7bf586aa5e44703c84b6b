DURBAN - After heading the drive team on East Coast Radio for almost exactly a year, presenter Bongani Mtolo is set to bid farewell to the Durban station. The station, known commonly as ECR, confirmed on Friday that the Drive show on Thursday, July 26 would be Mtolo's last. The reason, a statement reads, is that Mtolo is seeking other ventures. Mtolo began heading the Drive Show team in July last year, replacing controversial radio jock Phat Joe. The Richmond-born, Maritzburg College 'old boy' started his radio career at ECR in 2015 ultimately to work his way up to hosting the show with co-presenter Mags, and scooping the win for the Best Afternoon Drive Show presenter Liberty Radio Awards. East Coast Radio Programming Manager Zane Derbyshire said: “Bongani is a massively talented and ambitious presenter. He is a true example of working his way up, having presented late night and early morning shows to more recently being the host of the very successful East Coast Urban show and now hosting one of the premium shows on the station, East Coast Drive. We will miss his straight forward approach on the drive home and wish him nothing but success with his future endeavours.” About his departure, Mtolo said: “I’ve had an amazing time at East Coast Radio and I am very excited about my next chapter. Keep an eye out and an ear out to find out where my next chapter is going to be.” A stand-in presenter to co-host the East Coast Drive show with Mags and Gareth is set to be announced shortly.
