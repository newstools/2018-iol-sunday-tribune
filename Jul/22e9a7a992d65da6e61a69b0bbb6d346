Durban - Ratepayers have been urged to be on the look out for people posing municipal officials wanting to change electrical boards. This after some residents fell victim to individuals impersonating eThekwini officials and fraudulently charging residents to replace electrical boards. “The matter has been brought to the attention of the city via a customer, who wished to remain anonymous for personal safety reasons. The customer was recently approached by an individual, masquerading as a city official who falsely advised that the Municipality had ordered the replacement of the customers’ electricity boards and that it would automatically transmit the meter readings to the municipality,” said Mandla Nsele, eThekwini Municipality’s Acting Head of Communications. Peet du Plessis, Head of Revenue Management said, “The customer asked for verification and was subjected to a phone call to another individual pretending to work at the municipality. The customer also paid in excess of R8 000 cash and was not provided with any receipts.” Du Plessis said afterwards the victim contacted the municipality. He said that the municipality will never ask for cash on site and encouraged customers to be wary of such individuals. “We urge customers to always be vigilant as there are fraudulent people looking to make a quick buck. If customers have not asked for any work to be conducted, it must be regarded as suspicious,” he said. Customers can contact 080 311 1111 or the city Integrity and Investigations Unit on 0800 202020 if they witness or are subjected to such scams. Daily News
