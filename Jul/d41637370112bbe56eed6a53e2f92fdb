DURBAN - Police swooped on a Durban CBD warehouse on Friday where more than 500 boxes of counterfeit sanitary pads were seized. The intelligence driven operation was spearheaded by the provincial Organised Crime Unit after they were tipped off about a supplier who had been dumping counterfeit Always Ultra Pads on the market. The warehouse is situated on Bertha Mkhize (Victoria) Street. A police source said that research into the products revealed that if the pads were contaminated with bacteria it could pose a health risk. A 39-year-old Ethiopian national was arrested at the scene and will appear in the Durban Magistrate’s Court soon. “We can confirm a suspect was arrested in Victoria Street after he was found in possession of 509 cartons of counterfeit sanitary pads. Another 409 cartons of razors were also confiscated. The members acted on intelligence-driven information about the counterfeit goods,” said police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala. The suspect was charged with possession of counterfeit goods. Ayotomiwa Ajewole, spokesperson for Procter and Gamble, the manufacturer of Always Ultra Pads in South Africa said the company was aware of the black market and was working with authorities. “Strict processes are followed to ensure that our sanitary pads meet health requirements. Therefore I am unable to comment on the health risks of the counterfeit products,” Ajewole said. Dr Greta Dreyer president of the SA Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said sanitary pads were for external use and would only pose health risks if contaminated by bacteria. “Other than that, it is considered a low-risk product,” said Dreyer. Meanwhile, in May, thousands of fake sanitary pads were seized in Mpumalanga. The pads were found at an illegal manufacturing facility in Rorke’s Drift. Fourteen immigrants employed at the factory were arrested. This included 12 Malawians and two Chinese workers. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
