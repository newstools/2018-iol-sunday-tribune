DURBAN - FOUR township schools in KwaZulu-Natal will receive furniture donations from a big commercial bank on Friday. The schools - Mzuvele High School and NqabakaZulu High School, both in KwaMashu, Ndonyela High School in Mbumbulu, and New River Combined School in Inanda - will receive furniture, including office tables, chairs, whiteboards and couches, from Standard Bank. Two other schools Bambisandla Primary in KwaMashu and Zuzumqhele Secondary School in Malukazi, near uMlazi, will see 50 pupils handed uniforms. The schools were identified by the Department of Education through a provincial government initiative called 'Sukuma Sakhe'. The KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Nomusa Dube is expected to attend the event on Friday on behalf of the provincial government. Provincial Private Sector Senior manager at Standard Bank, Nelisiwe Mkhize, said the schools were in dire need of the resources. “To me, this is a personal experience that I went through in a township school that I attended. There was no furniture, we were made to sit on the concrete floor for classes. Recently, I was touched when I visited a school in the rural area, its conditions were worse (than mine) it had no tables or chairs. The need for private sector to lend a hand is still huge,” Mkhize said. Cogta spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said Dube was passionate about addressing the challenges facing schools in previously disadvantaged communities. “This initiative is part of the Provincial Government’s efforts to work with the private sector role players for the betterment of lives of residents across the province,” he said. nkululeko.nene@inl.co.za SUNDAY TRIBUNE
