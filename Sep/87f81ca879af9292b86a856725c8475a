Durban - A man, believed to be in his 40s, was killed on Friday morning when he was knocked off his bicycle by an unknown vehicle on Wyebank Road in Kloof. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring saidÂ paramedics arrived on the scene at 7.30am to find the body of the man lying on the right-hand side of the road next to his bicycle. Paramedics assessed the man and found that he had already died from his injuries. There was no vehicle found on the scene. The paramedics said police were on the scene to investigate further. Police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said that this morning at about 7.30 am, a 48-year-old male cyclist was found on the Wyebank Road. "He was declared dead at the scene but he had no visible injuries. Pinetown police are investigating an inquest and circumstances around the incident." Meanwhile on the M41 between the Phoenix and N2 on ramps, a man in his 30s died after being hit by a car at about 10.30am on Friday. Crisis medical spokesman Kyle van Reenen said paramedics found the man in a critical condition and requested the assistance of the IPSS medical helicopter. Van Reenen said as the helicopter arrived, the patient went into cardiac arrest. "Paramedics worked fervently to stabalise the man and after about 30 minutes a pulse was returned. Due to the man being unstable for flight, he was taken rapidly to Mahatma Gandhi Hospital." The patient died at the hospital. The road was closed for emergency services personnel and the helicopter landing, but has since been reopened. The Independent on Saturday
