Metrorail officials, Durban mayor Zandile Gumede and train commuters will meet to discuss new security measures. Prasa Metrorail KZN spokesperson Zama Nomnganga said there would be tighter security at every train station. Two Fridays ago commuters attacked and burned the uMlazi ticket office, trains and staff vehicles parked near the station, leading to the suspension of the service. Police spokesperson Colonel Thulani Zwane said no arrests had been made yet following damage estimated at R8million. This latest wave of public violence affecting rail infrastructure comes after similar protests in Gauteng and the Western Cape. The City of Cape Town has been especially hard hit by vandalism and arson, losing on average more than 50 train carriages a year to nefarious acts. A recent spate of burnings has left Metrorail services in the city on the verge of collapse with fewer than 50 trains left to service the community. Sunday Tribune
