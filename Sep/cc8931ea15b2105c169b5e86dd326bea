DURBAN - A group of ten medical students from the Nelson R Mandela School of Medicine at the University of KwaZulu-Natal who were arrested this week, were released on a warning after appearing at the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Friday. The students had been arrested by police and charged under the illegal gatherings Act on Thursday. The students have been on strike for the last two weeks, for among other reasons, issues pertaining to the university’s Pietermaritzburg residence where some of the students live. They have also bemoaned alleged mismanagement of funds by the university. The students are also demanding a report back from university management regarding an investigation into the sale of places at the institution. UKZN spokesperson Normah Zondo said management had been engaging with student leadership regarding their concerns. “Many of the concerns have been resolved. Management remains committed to continuous engagement to reach an amicable and viable solution,” said Zondo. The Medical School’s Student Representative Council (MSRC) president Ahmed Raja said on Friday that student leadership were still awaiting a meeting with university management to find a way forward. The 10 students who were released on a warning will appear in court again on October 2. nabeelah.shaikh@inl.co.za
