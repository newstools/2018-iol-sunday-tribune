Durban - The funeral service for Miguel Louw, 9, whose body was found in a shallow grave in Phoenix will be held on Saturday. The Louw family said the funeral will take place at the St Anne's Catholic Church on Randles Road in Sydenham on Saturday from 10.30am. A full Requiem Mass will convene thereafter at 11 am. The family have requested that people who want to attend the funeral wear white as a sign of purity for Miguel. Domenic King of Combined Community Watch, who had been part of a team searching for Miguel since he went missing on July 17, said the family had finally received closure on the matter. Louw's decomposed body was found by police in bushes alongside Longbury Drive last week. King and other relatives have been trickling into the Louw family home on Dr RD Naidu Drive on Thursday morning to pay their condolences. A relative of the family told the Daily News that the father Kirk Louw had gone to the Phoenix Mortuary on Wednesday morning for the results but he was told that it was not available. On Wednesday afternoon police officials came to the family home and informed them that the DNA results proved the body was that of Louw. Colonel Thembeka Mbele, a KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said the post-mortem results were still being compiled. Mohammed Ebrahim,43, the man accused of kidnapping him is awaiting trial at the Westville Correctional Services. He was granted bail of R2500 but opted not to pay it so he could remain in police custody. Daily News
