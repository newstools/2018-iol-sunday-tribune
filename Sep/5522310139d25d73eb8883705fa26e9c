Durban - The student accused of murdering a fellow University of Zululand student has been remanded in custody pending a bail application, police said on Wednesday. Sibonakaliso Mbatha, 25, appeared in absentia at the Mtunzini Magistrates Court on Wednesday. The accused is under police guard at a hospital after being severely injured on Sunday when students assaulted him with rocks, sticks and glass after he allegedly murdered fellow student, Sazi Ngubo. On Sunday, videos showing the assault on the accused went viral on social media. The videos showed campus security struggling to stop a mob of students from assaulting with objects, the murder accused. Provincial police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said Mbatha would be remanded in custody until September 25, where he will appear in court for a formal bail application. The Mercury reported on Wednesday that Police Minister Bheki Cele had condemned the vigilantism seen at the university and assured students those involved would be harshly dealt with. Cele was addressing hundreds of students at the university’s Walter Gcabashe Hall to raise concerns about their safety. “I have instructed police to identify everyone on the video (of the students attacking the murder suspect),” he said.“I’m not going to stand here and lie to you. Whether you want to hear this or not, this shall be done.”Daily News
