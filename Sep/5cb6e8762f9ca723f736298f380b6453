Several sources linked to the investigation alleged the delay in the arrest of at least 30 suspects - including students, parents and UKZN staffers - was a deliberate attempt to jeopardise the investigation. Since the investigation, which began more than a year ago, only three suspects have been arrested. The accused, Durban restaurateurs Varsha and Hitesh Bhatt of the Little Gujarat Restaurant, along with uMhlanga businesswoman Preshni Hiramun, were nabbed in May last year for selling places to study medicine and other health science courses at UKZN for up to R500000 a spot. In March, Magistrate Correl Language warned that if the State was not ready to proceed with the case at the next court date, which is in November, the charges would be provisionally withdrawn. NPA spokesperson Natasha Ramkisson Kara said the NPA had been working with police on the investigation and the perceived delay was due to the complexity of the investigation. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
