Director of Public Prosecutions in KZN advocate Moipane Noko said this week’s ruling to decriminalise cannabis did not affect cases already on court rolls. “The judgment does not mean the NPA will not prosecute cases of possession of cannabis.” Noko added that each case would be decided on its own merit. Minister of Police Bheki Cele said the Constitutional Court ruling on marijuana had left police confused. Speaking in Kimberley, he said they did not know how to deal with people in possession of dagga. “It’s going to be difficult because we were still instructed by the judge to arrest. So, now we do not know what we are supposed to arrest for, how many plants you are allowed to cultivate at home, or whether we are supposed to move around with scales to weigh the dagga.” Sunday Tribune
