DURBAN - IF you’ve ever been intrigued by the Islamic call to prayer or wondered what lay behind the doors of the local mosque, you now have the chance to find answers to your questions soon. On Heritage Day, selected mosques across the country will open their doors to the public to explore Islamic tradition and culture. The SA Muslim Network’s,  Dr Faisal Suliman has urged the country to use Heritage Month to learn about our diverse nation. “All South Africans are encouraged to share their culture, language and religion. Given the theme of Heritage Month, we have invited communities to visit and tour  mosques, and ask questions,” he said. "Eleven mosques in Durban, including the iconic Grey Street Juma Masjid in the Durban CBD, will be open for a tour on September 24, from 2pm to 4pm. “Let’s build relations by asking questions, perhaps about the washing rituals and the prayer itself. A Moulana, trustees of the mosques, or volunteers, will be present to guide you through the mosque,” he said. At certain mosques, you may also be allowed to partake in the daily prayer, should you wish, Suliman said. Selected mosques in Chatsworth, Phoenix, Pinetown, and Pietermaritzburg will also be open.
