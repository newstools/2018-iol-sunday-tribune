Durban - Have you seen or have knowledge of corrupt actions being committed by government employees? These should be reported to the National Anti-Corruption Hotline on 0800 701 701. This is the message from the Public Service and Administrations Minister Ayanda Dlodlo, in recognition of Public Service Month, which is being marked this September. “I urge public servants as well as citizens that, when you exposed to or know of any kind of corrupt activity taking place within the government system, please call the National Anti-Corruption Hotline on 0800 701 701 to report such activity,” said Dlodlo. Public Service Month, said Dlodlo, is meant to honour the men and women who serve the country with pride, dignity and commitment. “It also serves as a mechanism to assess the quality of service delivery with a view to improve the quality of our service offering to comply to the standards of the Batho Pele Principles of accountability, quality service and commitment...during the Public Service Month and beyond, we should demonstrate that we are committed to building a caring public administration,” she said. Batho Pele principles, she said, required public servants to inform citizens, give access to services they are entitled to, public servants should give citizens access to services they are entitled to, be open and transparent, and be courteous.
