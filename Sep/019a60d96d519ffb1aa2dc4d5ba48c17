Durban - More than 800 million people around the world are hungry. This was revealed in an alarming new report titled “The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018”. The report was released by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), people around the world were not getting enough nutritious food to eat, and children bore the brunt of the burden, with stunted growth. “The alarming signs of increasing food insecurity and high levels of different forms of malnutrition are a clear warning that there is considerable work to be done to make sure we ‘leave no one behind’ on the road towards achieving the sustainable development goals on food security and improved nutrition,” said the FAO in a statement. The study was conducted with the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the UN Children's Fund, and the World Food Programme and WHO. Nearly 151 million children, aged under 5, are too short for their age due to malnutrition in 2017. The figures are slightly better than 2012’s data, which showed that 165 million children had stunted growth. Globally, Africa and Asia accounted for 39% and 55% of all stunted children, respectively. The report called for policy changes and interventions that would ensure better nutrition and food access to especially infants, children aged under five, school-aged children, adolescent girls, and women.
