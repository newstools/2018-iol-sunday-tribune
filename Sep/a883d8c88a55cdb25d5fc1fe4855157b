My education programmes are usually aimed at the young. Through the programmes I run, I’m hoping to raise a new generation of responsible people.” He said he delved into the relevance of tourism and how it helped to sustain the country’s economy. “I have all this knowledge in my head and I want to share this with local communities. They too can become nature, tourism and bird guides. I don’t intend to train many more bird guides, then my expertise won’t be needed,” Mthembu quipped.
