Durban - A man who killed a woman and her baby has been sentenced to two life terms by the Durban High Court, police said on Friday. In December last year, the body of 25-year-old Zinhle Ntuli and her 5-year-old daughter Snothile, were found buried in a shallow grave in Seatides, near oThongathi. A resident had noticed blood on a pathway leading to a bush at the Seatides circle on the M4 highway and immediately alerted police. When police officers reported to the scene they made a gruesome discovery of the bodies of the mother and child, who both had open wounds to their heads. Acting provincial commissioner, Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi welcomed the sentence imposed on murderer Bhamuza Gumede, 30.   Police said the accused went into hiding after the murderous act and was traced to Jozini on December 31 last year. “We wish to commend Detective Sergeant Pinky Mazwayi from Tongaat SAPS for working tirelessly to ensure that the suspect is arrested and placed before court in a short space of time after the bodies were discovered. His hard work and dedication in putting together a well investigated case before court contributed to the suspect being convicted. We are pleased that this cold blooded killer is behind bars where he belongs and will not be able to harm any more women and children in our province,” said Mkhwanazi. DAILY NEWS
