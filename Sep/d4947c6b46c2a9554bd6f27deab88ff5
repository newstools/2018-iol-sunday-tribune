Paramedics had to use the jaws of life to retrieve Sbahle from the mangled car wreckage. Tuesday marked Sbahle’s parents wedding anniversary. It's been 11 years since Durban business power duo, Shaun and Sbu Mpisane have been married. From Sbahle's hospital bed, the model and her younger brother Andile took to Instagram to wish their parents a happy anniversary. “Hi guys, today is our parents 11th anniversary and we're very excited. And thank you guys for making me feel better, the presents and everything. I love you guys,” said Sbahle on her brothers Instagram post. In the video, Sbahle is surrounded by flowers and gifts she has received from family and friends. Last week, her boyfriend Itumeleng Khune, goalkeeper for Kaizer Chiefs and Bafana Bafana tweeted hinting that Sbahle was in advanced stage of her recovery.      Khune has been by her bedside this week as the Bafana Bafana vs Libya game was being held at Moses Mabhida Stadium. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
