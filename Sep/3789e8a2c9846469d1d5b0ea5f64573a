Durban - Police Minister Bheki Cele said police were investigating further why a man linked to cash heists may be involved involved in the murder of former ANC Youth League leader Sindiso Magaqa. He was addressing the press at a media briefing in Durban on Thursday. Cele revealed that the suspect was an alleged hitman who had allegedly been involved in cash heists around the province. Cele said they would not name the man as they did not want to jeopardise their case. Acting provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, said a police task team linked Magaqa's murder to a man, who was already in police custody.

The National Prosecuting Authority had confirmed earlier on Thursday that the accused appeared at the Umzimkhulu Magistrates Court and was charged with murder, for Magaqa's death, and attempted murder, for the two councillors who had been with him in the car - Jabulile Mzizi and Nonsikelelo Mafa. The accused would appear in court next Thursday. Cele said police were still investigating why an alleged cash heist suspect would kill the former ANC Youth League secretary general. “The (alleged Sindiso Magaqa killers) were identified some time ago. The one that appeared today was found and was investigated. “Why would a cash heist person go and kill the (former) secretary-general of the ANC Youth League. Those are the things that the investigators will have to investigate. You can’t just be a cash heist guy and the next day you go and you kill a politician,” said Cele. Cele said another suspect had been identified and police believed there was more information that would be uncovered. “It's fine to find the trigger puller, but we want to find the masterminds,” said Cele.
