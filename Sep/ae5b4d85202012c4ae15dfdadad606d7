DURBAN - THE life of a blossoming Durban actress was cut short when she died in an early morning car accident on Saturday. The car she was travelling in crashed into a wall on Botanic Gardens Road on Saturday around 1am. The young actress, Owethu Enhle Gambushe, 22, along with another young woman, whose identity was yet to be confirmed by police, died when a BMW allegedly driven by a 47-year-old man crashed into a wall in the Berea area. Paramedics said five people were in the car, including the man who was arrested and who has since been charged with culpable homicide and driving under the influence, police said on Saturday. Police were also investigating circumstances that led to the accident. Gambushe, who played the role of Nonhlanhla on e.TV’s drama series Imbewu: The Seed, had broken into the acting scene this year. She had also studied television production at AFDA in Durban, her Instagram biography showed.      Rescue Care paramedics said the deceased - both young girls in their 20s, were declared dead on the scene. The 47-year-old man is expected to appear in the Durban Magistrates Court on Monday. In an interview with the Sunday Tribune on Saturday, Leleti Khumalo, the executive producer of the show, said cast members were deeply saddened by the passing of Gambushe. "It's unbelievable, we are sad. We are liaising with the family and they have requested space to deal with this tragedy," said Khumalo.  Meanwhile on social media, #RIPEnhleGambushe trended after the story of her passing broke on Saturday afternoon.  The reactions came from as far and wide as Felicia Mabuza-Suttle, the US-based former SABC TV presenter, who was amongst many on Twitter who reacted to the news.      Portia Gumede, an actor and production owner, was among those who reacted - as she sent strength to the family of the young actress.      TV critic Phil Mphela also weighed in.      Media personality Tembisa Mdoda said:      The drama series tweeted about the incident late on Saturday night.      Fellow Imbewu: The Seed actress Portia Ncwane, who referred to Gambushe as her twin, was heartbroken.                      @SihleSays   @SundayTribuneSA  SUNDAY TRIBUNE
