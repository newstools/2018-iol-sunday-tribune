Durban - Search and rescue teams were searching for the body of a man who washed out to sea while performing a baptism ritual in Rocky Bay, on the south coast of KwaZulu Natal on Friday. Kevin Fourie, NSRI Rocky Bay station commander, said that just after 7am the duty crew were activated following reports of a drowning in progress at Sezela. Fourie said a man and woman had been swept out to sea after being caught in rip currents during a baptism in the surf. "I had my private boat, Miracle, on the water at the time and responded to the scene. Our NSRI duty crew and Police Search and Rescue responded and our sea rescue craft Freemasons Way was launched," he said." The body of the woman was located in the surf behind the surf breaker line approximately a kilometre from where they were washed out to sea. The NSRI team brought the body of the woman onto the sea rescue craft and brought it ashore. NSRI crew and Police Search and Rescue divers manned the sea rescue craft searching in the surfline and shore patrols for the man's body. The body of the deceased female was taken into the care of the Forensic Pathology Services. An ongoing search operation for the man is continuing. Police have opened an inquest docket. Daily News
