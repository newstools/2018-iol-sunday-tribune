Durban - Police and private security officers swooped on the scene of a business robbery and arrested four suspects who were stealing kilos of sugar and rice at Durban's Maydon Wharf on Monday. The alleged criminals were driving in an unauthorized truck. Provincial police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the incident. "Three unknown suspects entered the business premises at Maydon Wharf Road, with a truck. The suspects loaded 120 bags of sugar and another 50 kg bag of rice. The security guards responded and police officers were immediately contacted. Four suspects including the employee were arrested," she said. The suspects are expected to appear at the Durban Magistrates Court on business robbery charges.  Blue Security spokesperson Andreas Mathios said: “One of the several security guards working on site pressed a panic alarm when he realised that a truck with no authorisation to collect cargo from the property had arrived and suspects had started loading the truck with goods,” Mathios said. “Our officers arrived swiftly at the scene and managed to arrest all four suspects, including the driver of the truck. The suspects were handed over to the Maydon Wharf SAPS,” Mathios said. Independent on Saturday
