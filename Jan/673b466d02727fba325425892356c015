Fans of the late music stalwart Hugh Masekela can reminisce about his music tonight when M-Net and MultiChoice honours Masekela with special programmes on Mzansi Magic Music. Masekela, a South African jazz icon, passed away on Tuesday at the age of 78 after fighting prostate cancer since being diagnosed with the disease in 2008. The award-winning artist died peacefully at his home in Johannesburg, according to his family, who said that funeral details would be announced soon. While tributes from across the world have been pouring in for Masekela, MultiChoice General Entertainment chief executive Yolisa Phahle, said special programmes will commence this evening to honour the legend on DStv channel 321. One of Masekela’s last live TV performances was at the first DStv Mzansi Magic Viewers Choice Awards in August. Phahle said: “I have some very precious personal memories as he was a close family friend and a major inspiration to me as a young musician. Hugh Masekela told the South African story in an inimitable way. Through his music, the fight for democracy reached audiences all over the world, and to us, he was the voice of hope during dark times. Hugh was acknowledged by the greatest musicians in the world for his craft.” The ‘Best of Hugh Masekela Special’ will start from 12pm. ‘Friends of Hugh Masekela’ will air at 1pm. ‘Hugh Masekela Live at the Market Theatre’ will air at 2pm. The specials will be available on Catch Up from 6pm tonight, and will be repeated during the week. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
