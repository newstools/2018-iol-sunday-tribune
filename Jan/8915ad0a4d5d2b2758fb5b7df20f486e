  [IMPORTANT NOTICE]: All the stores of that racist retailer @hmsouthafrica are CLOSED. Racism must fall and we will never tip toe around racists. pic.twitter.com/eqmw885k6X   — Floyd Shivambu (@FloydShivambu) January 13, 2018    That @hm nonsense of a clothing store is now facing consequences for its racism. All rational people should agree that the store should not be allowed to continue operating in South Africa. Well done to Fighters who physically confronted racism. pic.twitter.com/cgdedYGoOj   — Floyd Shivambu (@FloydShivambu) January 13, 2018    The time of apologies for racism are over; there must be consequences to anti-black racism, period! #EFFprotest https://t.co/0PZlC4cpOr   — IG: @MbuyiseniNdlozi (@MbuyiseniNdlozi) January 13, 2018
