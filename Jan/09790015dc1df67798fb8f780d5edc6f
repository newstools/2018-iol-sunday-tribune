Durban - The suspension of a metro police official who allegedly made death threats to the unit’s senior human resources officer was ruled unfair by the Bargaining Council this week.
The council ruled Nhlanhla Mthethwa must be paid R180000 compensation within 14 days in relation to the allegations. But having emerged victorious from the legal battle with his employers, Mthethwa was issued with another notice of intention to have him suspended over new charges. Mthethwa was initially suspended last July after the human resources officer reported death threats against her when they clashed over vacant posts within the unit. Metro management was ordered to finalise its internal inquiry over the alleged threats by January 17. Attorney Reg Thomas said the commissioner had ruled Mthethwa could return to work on January 22 if the city failed to finalise the matter. “The commissioner found the suspension to be procedurally and substantively unfair and ordered the municipality to pay compensation,” said Thomas. “All investigations have been completed. The city needs to establish whether the death threats were real or not.” Thomas said the new charges related to tender irregularities. “On Friday, they sent him a notice saying they (management) would suspend him. They want to bring new charges against him so that they can keep him suspended. “He’s not involved in the tender irregularity charges he faces,” said Thomas. SAPS spokesperson Thulani Zwane said a case was opened at Durban Central police station and was withdrawn because of insufficient evidence. eThekwini Municipality’s deputy head of communications Mandla Nsele said they did not speak to third parties about internal matters. Mthethwa was known to have been a close ally of the former head of metro police, Eugene Nzama, and the unit has been working on “cleaning” it up since his departure.  siphelele.buthelezi@inl.co.za  SUNDAY TRIBUNE
