DURBAN - The call to relieve Palestine from gruesome violence, has escalated in Durban with at least 3500 protesters taking to the streets of Overport on Saturday to add their voice to the campaign. Shouting 'Free free Palestine', children were among those who joined their parents to shout to passerby's about the atrocities Palestinians are currently facing in the midst of the Israel-Palestine conflict.

The demonstration was organised by the group 'People Against Oppression'. Shabnam Palesa Mohamed, among the protestors, spoke of how more South Africans can join the movement to #FreePalestine. "They (Palestinians) are oppressed, they are under military occupation, there is a genocide going on Palestine. People have no food, no electricity, and they can't get in or out of Gaza. As South Africans we have to stand with the rest of the international community to says 'enough is enough'," Mohamed said. "The time may come soon where we might say 'there are no longer Palestinians,' and that will be the saddest time in our history," she added.   Among the chants of protestors were the words believed to be shouted by Palestinians each day: "With our blood and our bodies we will free Palestine."
