To achieve this goal, the party has announced the launch of the LGBTQI Forum. National convener Thomas Stofberg said ADec understood the importance of embracing diversity to liberate the hearts and minds of South Africans. “Our goal is to become a voice for the LGBTQI community in Parliament and to agitate for legislation to further advance the cause of equality and equity for all. “We hope to interact with as many civil organisations as possible and eventually create a weekly/bi-weekly interactive platform for discussions,” said Stofberg. “In the 24 years since our democratic dispensation, we have made great strides in creating a society enjoying the same freedoms. “Unfortunately, we still face the challenge of breaking and reconfiguring the societal norms that still persist today.” In celebration of International Pride month, Stofberg said it was important to take a positive stance against discrimination and violence toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, promote self-affirmation, dignity and equal rights, build community spirit and celebrate diversity.
