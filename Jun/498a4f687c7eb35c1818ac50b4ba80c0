DURBAN - POLICE have arrested three men linked to a bank robbery at a Durban North ABSA last week. The men were arrested on Friday afternoon by the SAPS Durban North Crime Prevention unit. The unit had been closely monitoring banks in the area after a business robbery the week earlier. The three suspects, who are aged between 32 and 34, were driving in a luxurious Silver C Class Mercedes Benz when police ran a registration check on the car, which was found to be false. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said the three suspects were found with two unlicensed firearms which had their serial numbers filed off. The Mercedes Benz they were driving in was found to have been stolen in a hijackingg in Sydenham last year, Zwane said. "All three suspects between the ages of 32 and 34 were arrested for Possession of Unlicensed firearm and Possession of Ammunition, Section 36 and Fraud. They will also be positively linked to a Business Robbery which occurred at the ABSA Bank last week," said Zwane. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
