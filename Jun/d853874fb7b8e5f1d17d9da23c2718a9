Now members of Durban Surf Lifesaving Club are calling for action. Among the concerns are faulty showers, broken paving and lumps of concrete lying around. While members of the club have commended the city for replenishing sand on the beaches through the recent sand-pumping operations, they said a lot more needed to be done to get the beach back into a good state. With school holidays having started, some surfers said visitors would be appalled at the conditions. Boogie boarder Biff Maggs, said loose electrical wires hanging down from loudspeakers were a danger. “We use the beaches throughout the year. We love our beaches. Seeing them in this state is really concerning. It’s been like this for almost three months now. “I have reported these matters to the city officials, including the beach manager, but they have not attended to it,” said Maggs, a club member. Others who spoke to City Watch said they had to walk long distances to other beaches to rinse off after surfing because North Beach’s showers were faulty. Surfer Jackson Martins said he expected better facilities given that the beaches are such a precious asset. eThekwini Municipality spokesperson Mandla Nsele had not responded by the time of going to press.
