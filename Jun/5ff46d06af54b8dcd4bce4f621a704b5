DURBAN - DOLPHINS cricket captain Khaya Zondo says the youth of today owe a lot to the youth of 1976. Khaya, the son of Deputy Chief Justice Ray Zondo believes the youth should pay forward the gratitude everyday for the sacrifices made on that heroic day, 42 years ago today. The Dolphins cricketer, who made his Proteas debut last year, said in days like today - he thought of the many unsung and nameless heroes of that day. “We often remember those in our faces as leaders, but there are people we don’t know about who left their families fighting for democracy. Some of them died,” said Zondo.

As a young South African, I am grateful for the opportunities that one has available to us today, especially in the sporting codes,” said Zondo, a Westville Boys High School Old Boy.
