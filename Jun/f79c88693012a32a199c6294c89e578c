READ: BeyHive left confused after the first #OTRII performance However, what set tongues wagging this week, is the official tour book â€” and the nude snaps which lies within. The book contains a series of pictures of Bey and Jay Z nudes. One snap is of the celebrity couple in bed, with Bey's cakes on display. And another her skinny dipping at a beach again.                   And while most people just admired the artistic nature, it didn't take long for people weigh in on Bey's marriage, or to draw up comparisonsÂ between her and Kim Kardashian West.               The way people are involved in BeyoncÃ©â€™ s marriage ðŸ¤£ like they know whatâ€™s best for her â€” ðŸŒˆ (@_renaey_xx) June 10, 2018      BeyoncÃ© didn't even post this on social media, it was apart of the visuals in OTR. Kim K post things as a distraction and actually gets praised. BeyoncÃ© doesn't do anything, literally but post her ig pics, and go on tour with her husband. Yall love to find ways to dislike her. â€” she's coming.
