He said the campaign was not political, urging all members of the society to partake in their personal capacities during the demonstrations. The demonstrations would be held amid speculations of another fuel increase next month. Fuel increased by 82 per cent per litre last month, motorists are now paying R15,54 a litre, since the beginning of June. Paraffin rose by R1,09 a litre while diesel increased by 87 cents. Reddy said: “This campaign will also help in fighting the racial tensions because petrol prices affects everybody regardless of race. Like during apartheid, we united for one course which was to defeat the apartheid system. Let’s unite again to fight the fuel increases.” Reddy, who is a member of the ANC called on the government to review the taxes related to fuel purchases and said it was the poor who felt the pinch. Energy Minister, Jeff Radebe said the increases were triggered by many factors including the fact that South Africa imported crude oil and finished products at a price set at international level. When the fuel price increase was made, the energy department urged motorists to save fuel by using lift clubs and public transport whenever they could. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
