DURBAN - DESPITE growing in the impoverished community of KwaXolo in the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast, Piwe Zulu has risen against the odds to become an off-road motorcyclist. Zulu, now 33, began his career in the sport not usually associated with black African men, in 2010. “I could not afford a motorbike. I had to work extra hours as a personal trainer and approach family and friends to save up for a motorbike. Then once, I got a bike, I had to put extra hours in on the track with experienced racers to learn technical skills,” he explained. Now living in Margate, the biker, who has rode for KTM Durban and RBS Yamaha in Pinetown, said he fell in love with off-road biking when he witnessed the annual biking tournament in Margate.

Freedom to express ourselves, dream and work in industries generations before we couldn't necessarily,” he said. With unemployment rife - especially among the youth - Zulu said young people should look for creative ways to realise their dreams. “Surround yourself with sound mentors and people who have achieved what you aspire to. Choose what information you read and be grateful and humble. Keep in mind that there are people and organisations that will notice your efforts if you persevere and work hard to stand out in your industry like my sponsors and mentors noticed me. My hard work has provided me with a strong support structure in many ways today,” he said. Read more #YouthDay stories here  Follow Siboniso Mngadi on Twitter @SbonisoMngadi  SUNDAY TRIBUNE
