DURBAN - A convicted Durban rapist who threatened a six-year-old child “not to tell anyone” is set to spend the rest of his life behind bars. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said convicted rapist Luvuyo Lusakhe, 29, was sentenced to life imprisonment at the Umlazi Regional Court. This after he confessed in court about how he had raped the six-year-old girl four years ago. “On March 25, 2014, the victim was playing at Umlazi area when she was approached by the accused. She was taken to the accused’s house where she was raped. The accused threatened the victim not to tell anyone about the incident,” said Zwane, in a statement.

A case of rape was opened at Umlazi police station for further investigation. Zwane said the police arrested the accused two days later. He made several court appearances until he was sentenced. At the start of the month on International Children's Day, a call was made for greater implementation on laws to protect children. Save Our Children spokesperson said: “One thing we know is that currently the environment is not safe and secure for our children to thrive. The laws are there, but what we need is implementation and we need everyone in society to get involved.” Also read: #InternationalChildrensDay: SA kids are at risk #ChildProtectionWeek: Child abuse costs country billions Move to beef up child protection measures SUNDAY TRIBUNE
