The molester made the apology behind closed doors in the public prosecutor’s office. The grandmother later told The Independent on Saturday she did not accept molester Glen Galley’s apology. The child’s father remained silent as Galley sought their forgiveness. “He said he did not know why he did it, that it was not his normal behaviour, that he is seeking help privately and he is glad he will get help in jail,” she said after his brief court hearing. “I told him he was a sick man with a serious problem, that it was horrendous what he had done and he did not have to apologise to me but to God because he had damaged a little child that is perfect as God’s creation. “I did not accept his apology,” she said. The child’s father said Galley acknowledged that “sorry won’t cut it”. Galley, a well-built, short-haired 47-year-old, will be sentenced on Wednesday. Soon after the meeting at which he apologised, he appeared in the Sexual Offences Court where he had been scheduled to be sentenced. The sentencing was postponed because there had been an amendment to a prior sentencing agreement. Galley will be sentenced for assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm on the grandmother, sexual assault on the child and common assault on the child. He pleaded guilty on all counts. The crimes were committed three days after Christmas when the child, who is now 7 years old, briefly left her grandmother’s care to buy chips in the confines of a family-friendly sports club. While she was buying refreshments, Galley coaxed her to follow him. When her grandmother went looking for her, cries of “Granny, Granny” led her to a men’s toilet. There, he attacked the grandmother. Club members came to the rescue and police arrested him.
