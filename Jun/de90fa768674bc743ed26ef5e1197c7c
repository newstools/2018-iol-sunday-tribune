Hoosen’s wife, Yasmin, 50, and his youngest daughter Zakkiyya, 18, a first-year medical student at the University of the Witwatersrand, planned to spare no effort in spoiling him today. His elder daughter, Fathima Zahraa, 22, a pharmacy student at Rhodes University, is busy with final examinations and will only see her father when he returns from his trip. Hoosen leaves for America tomorrow. Hoosen, 51, applied for the scholarship last November and is among 200 teachers from around the world who have been selected. Hoosen matriculated at Orient Islamic School and got his teaching degree from then University of Durban-Westville (now University of KwaZulu-Natal). He has been teaching for 25 years - teaching physical science to senior pupils, as well as natural science and mathematics at Avonford Secondary School in Phoenix. The seven-day scholarship is from Honeywell Solutions, a company linked to the US Space Programme. He will be based at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. He said all seminars, lectures and space-simulated activities would be held at the US Space and Rocket Centre in Huntsville. “My love for teaching was instilled by my mother, she was a teacher,” said Hoosen. “I am excited about the scholarship and learning more about science as well as interacting with other teachers. I am sure the opportunity will encourage me to give of my best to my learners when I return. The programme is directed at science teachers, to develop a holistic approach to space exploration.” Hoosen said he tried to make physical science interesting for pupils by linking theory to their surroundings. Last year, his matric pupils all passed physical science. “Physical science is a potpourri of sciences,” said Hoosen. The principal of Avonford Secondary, Thayabalin Reddy, said Hoosen was a gifted teacher with impeccable qualifications. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
