DURBAN - Mr P, the man accused of murdering Durban North woman Siam Lee, may finally hear on June 20 whether or not his bail application has been successful. He made his latest appearance in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Friday, when both the State and his defence made their closing arguments on the matter. The Assagay businessman, 29, faces a raft of charges, including the murder and kidnapping of Lee, fraud, crimen injuria and another rape charge not related to Lee. Mr P cannot not be named in the media because of the rape charges he faces. Lee, 20, disappeared from an alleged Durban North brothel on January 4. Her charred remains were found on a farm in the KZN Midlands two days later.

Based on the court turnout, the State argued that there was public support for Mr P being denied bail. During closing arguments, magistrate Mohamed Motala tore into the State’s argument by highlighting that he hadn’t heard enough about the murder of Lee over the 11-day bail hearing. He said the State’s only evidence was based on a vehicle-tracking report which placed Mr P at the place where Lee’s charred remains were found. Motala questioned the defence on the amount of bail Mr P could afford, if it were to be granted. Advocate Martin Krog said his client could afford an amount of R30000. Judgment is expected to be de- livered on June 20.  nabeelah.shaikh@inl.co.za  SUNDAY TRIBUNE
