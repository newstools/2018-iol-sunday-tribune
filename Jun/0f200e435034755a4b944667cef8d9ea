Three weeks ago the multi-billion construction of Go! Durban infrastructure came to a halt in Pinetown after threats were received, allegedly from local taxi owners unhappy with the development. Thami Manyathi, eThekwini Transport Authority, has since called a meeting to address all stakeholders’ concerns. “The city will present the designs and plans of the Go! Durban network as well as the subcontracting and empowerment opportunities that will be available during construction,” said Manyathi. “At these meetings small businesses and those from the relevant wards will be able to register as a provider of goods and services to the main contractors,” he said. Businesses from Wards 35, 58 and 102 are invited to meet tomorrow from 10am to 1pm at the Cornubia Housing Development. On Tuesday businesses from Wards 48, 49, 50, 51, 52 and 54 are invited from 10am to 1pm at the Phoenix Youth Centre. The last business consultation for Wards 11, 25, 34, 37, 40 and 41 will take place on Wednesday from 10am to 1pm at the Newlands East Community Hall. Manyathi encourages those who wish to register SMMEs and asks that they bring the following documents along; “CIPC - company registration document, BBBEE certificate, valid letter of good standing from Sars, tax clearance certificate from Sars, CIBD (if applicable), proof of company address, identification document, verification letter from the ward councillor confirming that the business is based in their ward.” SUJNDAY TRIBUNE
