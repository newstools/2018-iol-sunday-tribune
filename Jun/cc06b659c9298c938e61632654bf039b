Durban - The man accused of Zolile Khumalo's murder has abandoned his bail application. Khumalo's ex-lover Thabani Mzolo allegedly shot her dead at a Durban university residence in May. Mzolo appeared briefly at the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday morning, and through his attorney said he was abandoning his bail application. He is being kept at the Westville Correctional Centre until his next court appearance when he will appear via video conference. Mzolo, 23, is accused of murdering the 21-year-old first year Mangosuthu University of Technology student. In April, Khumalo was allegedly shot dead by Mzolo at her off-campus, Lonsdale residence in Durban. The pair had been reportedly dating but Khumalo is understood to have ended the relationship two weeks prior to her death which her friends say angered Mzolo. At his last court appearance it was alleged by the state prosecutor that Mzolo shot Khumalo twice, and then kicked her limp body as it lay on the floor. Mzolo angered members of the gallery at both his court appearances after pulling a "trigger sign" and showing the middle finger to media and members of the public as he descended into court cells.      Unlike previous court appearances, Mzolo’s show at the dock on Tuesday saw few protesters attending court. Khumalo’s father was among family members who attending court proceedings. Comfort Khumalo, said outside court, it was important for the Khumalo’s to see Mzolo in court. Comfort said while he was happy Mzolo abandoned bail, this would never bring Zolile back. “When I see him I think this is the person who took my child away,” he said. Comfort said he had not been in contact with Mzolo’s family. The case continues on August 29. Sunday Tribune
