DURBAN - A month after their daughter Zolile Khumalo's death, the Khumalo family is struggling to come to terms with the loss of "Zoe". The 21-year-old Mangosuthu University of Technology student was shot dead at her residence in the Durban CBD, allegedly by her ex-partner, Thabani Mzolo. The Khumalo family found a small sense of hope when Mzolo abandoned his bail application in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. In court, 23-year-old Thabani Mzolo, dressed in a purple blazer he wore previously, stood at the dock for less than ten minutes. Through his lawyer, Mzolo said he would no longer apply for bail. He will be detained at the Westville Correctional Centre, and will make a court appearance via video conference in August. Khumalo's father, Comfort Khumalo, sat on the cold, hard bench of the court on Tuesday, and said he felt pain when he saw Mzolo. “He must admit he murdered my child… even though that will not bring her back. When I see him in court my heart is filled with pain knowing he took the life of my child,” he said in isiZulu to media outside court.

About Mzolo’s middle-finger and trigger-signs in court, Comfort believed Mzolo showed no remorse for the death of Khumalo. “He behaved like he slaughtered his prey,” Comfort said. The Khumalo family have not yet received communication from Mzolo’s family following the incident and murder allegations.      The case resumes on August 29. - Additional reporting by Siboniso Mngadi. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
