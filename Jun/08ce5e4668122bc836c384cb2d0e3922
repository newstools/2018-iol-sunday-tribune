The untimely death of Sadia Sukhraj, 9, has sparked heated conversation among Durban residents about their safety and it also drew Cele to one such talk session. Since Sadia’s killing on Monday, there have been several meetings with high-level authorities, where residents have asked about police visibility, resources and response time. There has also been a call for an inquiry into the police’s reaction during a tense stand-off between protesters and police at the Chatsworth police station in the wake of Sadia’s death. The Sukhraj family has since been visited by several government officials including Cele, eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede, deputy mayor, Fawzia Peer, KZN Community Safety and Liason MEC Mxolisi Kaunda and Public Works MEC Ravi Pillay. But at a Wednesday night meeting convened by Pillay, Chatsworth resident Denise Ganas labelled government’s attention a “show”. Ganas’s husband was shot dead in a botched hijacking last year. “No statements were taken from witnesses, nothing’s been done, and it’s one year three months later. The very next day I had three visitors: Jakes Singh (Chatsworth CPF chairperson), Fawzia Peer and Visvin Reddy (ANC member). There were three pictures taken that day. “Fawzia Peer took pictures with me. The first picture we took she was not happy because her hair wasn’t right. The second picture her stomach was showing. So is that what they do when they come to our house and offer to support?” she asked. Ganas said a year later her case was still pending and no assistance had been given by those who promised to help her when the incident was in the spotlight, including Singh. Responding to Ganas and the queries of several others who demanded visible policing, Pillay said a committee should be formed that would create a document detailing the list of concerns and work with government representatives to resolve issues.
